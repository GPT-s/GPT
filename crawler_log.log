(Reuters) - Russia said on Saturday it was expelling more than 20 German diplomats in a tit-for-tat move. Germany did not immediately confirm any expulsions of its own, but said the arrival of a Russian government plane in Berlin was connected to the issue. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said Germany had decided to expel more than 20 Russians.
FIGHTING
* At least five Russian missiles hit the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and surrounding districts late on Saturday night, causing some damage to civilian buildings, local officials said.
* Russia's Defence Ministry said on Saturday that Russian assault troops had captured three more districts in the western part of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Ukrainian and Russian units have been battling for months over the eastern city, much of which lies in ruins.
* Units from Belarus returned home from Russia on Saturday after training on how to use the Iskander tactical missile system to launch nuclear weapons, the Belarusian defence ministry said.
ECONOMY
* The Group of Seven (G7) economic powers called on Sunday for the "extension, full implementation and expansion" of a critical deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea. Russia has strongly signalled that it will not allow the deal to continue beyond May 18.
* A first batch of Russian fertilizer which Latvia seized last year is being shipped to Kenya by the United Nations' World Food Programme, Latvia's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
Russia has cited the seizure as a key stumbling block to its continued participation in the Black Sea grains deal.
* Russia's richest people added $152 billion to their wealth over the past year, helped by high prices for natural resources - rebounding from the huge losses they experienced after the start of the war in Ukraine, Forbes Russia said.
DIPLOMACY, LEGAL
* Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Saturday he did not want to "please anyone" with his views about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, after provoking criticism in the West for suggesting Kyiv shared the blame for the war.
* Russia is advising citizens to avoid travel to Canada, citing what it calls numerous cases of discrimination against Russians, including physical violence, its foreign ministry said on Saturday.
* Ukraine plans to deploy software from U.S. data analytics provider Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) Inc to help it prosecute alleged war crimes committed by Russia, the company told Reuters.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla's market share in its key California market tumbled in the first quarter of the year despite aggressive price cuts as rivals stepped up, data showed on Friday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc controlled 59.6% of the battery electric market in California from January to March, down from 72.7% for all of 2022 and the lowest since 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the California Energy Commission.
Rivals such as Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet and Kia Corp increased their market shares in California during the period, although they remain in the single digits each.
Tesla's sales in California accounted for 16% of the automaker's global deliveries last year, according to Reuters calculation. California is the biggest U.S. state for zero emission vehicles.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter and embrace of Republicans has sparked concerns about Tesla's brand, especially in liberal states like California.
Tesla has been slashing prices in the United States since January, cutting prices six times in the key market.
The price cuts, which were also carried out in China, Europe and other countries, hit Tesla's first-quarter margins, pushing its shares down nearly 10% on Thursday.
Musk this week signaled the EV maker would prioritize sales growth ahead of profit in a weak economy.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The U.S. military evacuated American government personnel from Khartoum, President Joe Biden said on Saturday, adding that Washington is suspending operations at its embassy there as fighting between Sudan's rival commanders continued.
"This tragic violence in Sudan has already cost the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians," Biden said in a statement. "It's unconscionable and it must stop."
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that "all U.S. personnel and their dependents" have been safely evacuated and that the U.S. will continue to assist Americans in Sudan in planning for their own safety.
All U.S. government personnel and a small number of diplomatic personnel from other countries were evacuated in the operation, which removed fewer than 100 people, U.S. officials said.
Just over 100 U.S. special operations forces were involved in the evacuation, entering and exiting Sudan without being fired upon by the warring factions on the ground, U.S. military officials said.
Other foreign nationals began evacuating from a Red Sea port in Sudan on Saturday. Japan's TBS news reported that the United Nations staff members including Japanese nationals and their families would be evacuated from Sudan as early as Sunday.
The bloody onslaught of urban warfare has trapped large numbers in the Sudanese capital, disabling the airport and rendering some roads impassable.
The U.N. and foreign states have urged rival military leaders to honour declared ceasefires that have mostly been ignored, and to open safe passage for fleeing civilians and the supply of badly needed aid.
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers, four years after the overthrow of long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a popular uprising.
With the airport closed and skies unsafe, thousands of foreigners - including embassy staff, aid workers and students in Khartoum and elsewhere in Africa's third largest country - have also been unable to get out.
Saudi Arabia has evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.
'HOURS OF TERROR'
Western countries are expected to send planes for their citizens from Djibouti, though the Sudanese army has said airports in Khartoum and Darfur's biggest city, Nyala, are problematic and it was not clear when that might be possible.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the rival RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily since hostilities broke out on April 15.
Saturday's fighting breached what was meant to be a three-day truce from Friday to allow citizens to reach safety and visit family during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Each side accused the other of not respecting the truce.
"I don't have a problem with the ceasefire," Hemedti told Al Arabiya TV late on Saturday. The army "did not respect it. If they respect it, so will we."
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Residents of Khartoum and the adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri reported air strikes near the state broadcaster and battles in several areas including near the army headquarters.
One Bahri resident said there had been no water or electricity for a week and frequent air strikes. "We are waiting for the big fight. We are terrified of what's coming," she said, messaging later: "It's started."
TV feeds showed a huge cloud of black smoke rising from Khartoum airport.
Medecins Sans Frontieres appealed for safe passage. "We need ports of entry where we can bring specialist trauma staff and medical supplies," said Abdalla Hussein, Sudan operations manager for the medical charity.
The Sudanese doctors union said more than two-thirds of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service, with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in crossfire.
HUMANITARIAN RISK
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region that suffered a conflict which escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.
A U.N. update on Saturday said looters had taken at least 10 World Food Programme vehicles and six other food trucks after overrunning the agency's offices and warehouses in Nyala, south Darfur.
There has been no sign that either side can secure a quick victory or is ready to talk. The army has air power but the RSF is widely embedded in urban areas.
Burhan said on Saturday that "we all need to sit as Sudanese and find the right way out to return hope and life," his most conciliatory comments since fighting began.
Earlier in the clashes, he declared the RSF a rebel force, ordered it to be disbanded, and said a military solution was the only option. Hemedti said on Saturday he could not negotiate with Burhan.
Since Bashir's overthrow and after a 2021 coup, Burhan and Hemedti held the top positions on a ruling council that was meant to hand over to civilian rule and merge the RSF into the army.
The World Health Organization reported on Friday that 413 people had been killed and 3,551 injured since fighting broke out. The death toll includes at least five aid workers in a country reliant on food aid.

(Reuters) - British chipmaker Arm Ltd is building its own semiconductor to showcase the capabilities of its products, as it seeks to attract new customers and fuel growth following its Initial Public Offering (IPO) later this year, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
Arm will team up with manufacturing partners to develop the new semiconductor, FT said, citing people briefed on the move, adding that the company has built a new "solutions engineering" team that will lead the development of these prototype chips for mobile devices, laptops and other electronics.
The SoftBank Group Corp-backed company's newest chip, on which it started work in the past six months, is "more advanced" than ever before, FT said, citing industry executives.
The chip designer has no plans to sell or license the product and is only working on a prototype, FT said.
Arm is a major supplier of intellectual property to many chip companies, especially in mobile phones and has partnerships with major chip contract manufacturers.
Earlier this month, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) said it will work with Arm to ensure that mobile phone chips and other products that use Arm's technology can be made in Intel's factories.
Arm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The United States said it had evacuated its embassy staff from Sudan and France said it was evacuating diplomats on Sunday, as eight days of battles between rival military factions that have triggered a humanitarian crisis showed little sign of let-up.
President Joe Biden said the U.S. was temporarily suspending operations at its embassy in Khartoum but remained committed to the Sudanese people, reiterating calls for a ceasefire that have so far gone largely unheeded.
"The belligerent parties must implement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and respect the will of the people of Sudan," Biden said in a statement.
Live TV feeds showed thick smoke still hanging over the capital, Khartoum, and its sister cities of Bahri and Ombdurman, as gunfire continued to ring out in some areas, a Reuters reporter said.
The fighting erupted in Khartoum and other parts of the country on April 15, four years after long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir was toppled during a popular uprising, and has killed more than 400 people.
It pits Sudan's army against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who jointly staged a coup in 2021 but fell out during negotiations over a plan to form a civilian government and integrate the RSF into the armed forces.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily, including a three-day truce for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which began on Friday.
Intense fighting has continued around the army's headquarters in central Khartoum and the airport, which has been closed by the clashes, and over the past two days in Bahri, where the army has used troops on the ground as well as air strikes to try to push back the RSF.
The RSF said on Sunday that its forces were targeted by air strikes in Bahri's Kafouri district and that dozens were "killed and injured".
"We strongly condemn this treacherous behaviour, which is inconsistent with the declared commitment to the 72-hour truce," the RSF said in a statement.
CHINOOKS
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare has dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers.
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Diplomats and foreign nationals have also struggled to find a way out.
U.S. officials said special forces using aircraft including MH-47 Chinook helicopters swept into Sudan's battle stricken capital on Saturday from a U.S. base in Djibouti, spending just one hour on the ground to bring out fewer than 100 people.
"We did not take any small-arms fire on the way in and were able to get in and out without issue," said Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of operations at the military's Joint Staff.
Chris Maier, an assistant secretary of defense, said the U.S. military might use drone or satellite imagery to detect threats to Americans travelling on overland routes out of Sudan, or position naval assets at the Port of Sudan to aid Americans arriving there.
Under Secretary of State for Management John Bass said some Americans and other nationals had successfully travelled by land from Khartoum to Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which he said appeared to be a challenging journey given the lack of fuel, food and predictably available water.
Saudi Arabia has already evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.
Egypt, which has more than 10,000 citizens in Sudan, urged its nationals outside Khartoum to head to its consulate in Port Sudan, and to a consular office in Wadi Halfa on the border with Egypt, in preparation for their evacuation. It encouraged those in Khartoum to shelter in place and wait for the situation to improve.
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region bordering Chad that suffered a conflict that escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.

PARIS (Reuters) - France and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania expressed dismay after China's ambassador in Paris questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet countries like Ukraine.
Asked about his position on whether Crimea is part of Ukraine or not, Chinese ambassador Lu Shaye said in an interview aired on French television on Friday that historically it was part of Russia and had been offered to Ukraine by former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
"These ex-USSR countries don't have actual status in international law because there is no international agreement to materialize their sovereign status," Shaye added.
France responded on Sunday by stating its "full solidarity" with all the allied countries affected, which it said had acquired their independence "after decades of oppression".
"On Ukraine specifically, it was internationally recognized within borders including Crimea in 1991 by the entire international community, including China," a foreign ministry spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added that China will have to clarify whether these comments reflect its position or not.
The three Baltic states, all formerly part of the Soviet Union, reacted along the same lines as France.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, the wife of Britain's Prince Harry, criticised the British media on Saturday over reports that letters exchanged with King Charles played a part behind her decision not to attend his coronation, her latest confrontation with the press.
The Daily Telegraph reported Meghan had written to the now king to express her concerns about unconscious bias in the royal family. It said the letter was sent following her 2021 comments in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that the family had raised concerns about how dark her son's skin would be.
It reported the Duchess of Sussex did not feel she had received a satisfactory response to her concerns.
"The Duchess of Sussex is going about her life in the present, not thinking about correspondence from two years ago related to conversations from four years ago," a spokesperson for Meghan said.
"Any suggestion otherwise is false and frankly ridiculous. We encourage tabloid media and various royal correspondents to stop the exhausting circus that they alone are creating."
Prince Harry will attend the coronation next month without Meghan, who will remain in California with the couple's two young children. Their eldest, Archie, turns four on the same day.
Harry and Meghan stepped down from royal duties in March 2020, saying they wanted to make new lives in the United States away from media harassment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - All U.S. government personnel were evacuated from Washington's embassy in Khartoum, as well as a small number of diplomatic personnel from other countries, U.S. officials said on Saturday, as fighting rocks Sudan.
The operation evacuated fewer than 100 people, the officials told reporters.
"We evacuated all of the U.S. personnel and dependents assigned to Embassy Khartoum," said Under Secretary of State for Management John Bass.
A substantial number of local staff remain in Khartoum supporting the embassy, where Washington decided to suspend operations on Saturday due to the security risks, Bass said.
Forces commanded by two previously allied leaders of Sudan's ruling council began a violent power struggle last weekend. Washington on Saturday repeatedly called on the parties to extend and expand a ceasefire for the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday to a sustainable cessation of hostilities.
Each side has accused the other of not respecting the truce.
The evacuation operation conducted on Saturday involved just over 100 U.S. special operations forces and began at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) when U.S. aircraft, including three MH-47 Chinook transport helicopters, took off from a U.S. base in Djibouti, stopped in Ethiopia to refuel, then flew the last three hours to Khartoum.
    U.S. forces spent just an hour on the ground in Sudan before taking off again, entering and exiting Sudan without being fired upon by the warring factions on the ground, the military said.
    "We did not take any small-arms fire on the way in and were able to get in and out without issue," said Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of operations at the military's Joint Staff.
The U.S. does not anticipate the security situation in the country changing in the near term, Bass said, adding that Washington does not foresee coordinating a U.S. government evacuation of American citizens in Sudan now or in coming days.
The U.S. military is looking at options to offer Americans some assistance exiting Sudan, while stopping short of a U.S. government-led evacuation, like the one it carried out in Afghanistan in 2021. 
    Chris Maier, an assistant secretary of defense, said the U.S. military might use drone or satellite imagery to detect threats to Americans traveling on overland routes out of Sudan, or position naval assets at the Port of Sudan to aid Americans arriving there.
Bass said some Americans and other nationals had successfully traveled by land from Khartoum to Port Sudan, which he said appeared to be a challenging journey given the lack of fuel, food and predictably available water.
While the State Department is not recommending or advising people to take that route, he said they would be looking for ways to help them make the journey.
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee said Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed offered the full support of the country, which neighbors Sudan and Djibouti, for overflight and refueling capabilities in the evacuation operation.
Washington has worked to repair relations with Addis Ababa that were strained by a two-year war in the northern region of Ethiopia.

(Reuters) - Russia said on Saturday it was expelling more than 20 German diplomats in a tit-for-tat move. Germany did not immediately confirm any expulsions of its own, but said the arrival of a Russian government plane in Berlin was connected to the issue. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said Germany had decided to expel more than 20 Russians.
FIGHTING
* At least five Russian missiles hit the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and surrounding districts late on Saturday night, causing some damage to civilian buildings, local officials said.
* Russia's Defence Ministry said on Saturday that Russian assault troops had captured three more districts in the western part of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Ukrainian and Russian units have been battling for months over the eastern city, much of which lies in ruins.
* Units from Belarus returned home from Russia on Saturday after training on how to use the Iskander tactical missile system to launch nuclear weapons, the Belarusian defence ministry said.
ECONOMY
* The Group of Seven (G7) economic powers called on Sunday for the "extension, full implementation and expansion" of a critical deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea. Russia has strongly signalled that it will not allow the deal to continue beyond May 18.
* A first batch of Russian fertilizer which Latvia seized last year is being shipped to Kenya by the United Nations' World Food Programme, Latvia's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
Russia has cited the seizure as a key stumbling block to its continued participation in the Black Sea grains deal.
* Russia's richest people added $152 billion to their wealth over the past year, helped by high prices for natural resources - rebounding from the huge losses they experienced after the start of the war in Ukraine, Forbes Russia said.
RUSSIAN OFFICIAL'S SON
* The son of Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said in an interview published on Saturday that he had served in Ukraine under an assumed name as an artilleryman in the Wagner mercenary force, the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reported. Nikolai Peskov, the 33-year-old son of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, told the privately-owned newspaper that he had served in Ukraine, a rare, public example of the son of a senior Russian official fighting in the war.
DIPLOMACY
* France and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania expressed dismay after China's ambassador in Paris questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet countries like Ukraine.
* Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Saturday he did not want to "please anyone" with his views about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, after provoking criticism in the West for suggesting Kyiv shared the blame for the war.
* Russia is advising citizens to avoid travel to Canada, citing what it calls numerous cases of discrimination against Russians, including physical violence, its foreign ministry said on Saturday.
WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATIONS
* Ukraine plans to deploy software from U.S. data analytics provider Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) Inc to help it prosecute alleged war crimes committed by Russia, the company told Reuters.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla's market share in its key California market tumbled in the first quarter of the year despite aggressive price cuts as rivals stepped up, data showed on Friday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc controlled 59.6% of the battery electric market in California from January to March, down from 72.7% for all of 2022 and the lowest since 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the California Energy Commission.
Rivals such as Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet and Kia Corp increased their market shares in California during the period, although they remain in the single digits each.
Tesla's sales in California accounted for 16% of the automaker's global deliveries last year, according to Reuters calculation. California is the biggest U.S. state for zero emission vehicles.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter and embrace of Republicans has sparked concerns about Tesla's brand, especially in liberal states like California.
Tesla has been slashing prices in the United States since January, cutting prices six times in the key market.
The price cuts, which were also carried out in China, Europe and other countries, hit Tesla's first-quarter margins, pushing its shares down nearly 10% on Thursday.
Musk this week signaled the EV maker would prioritize sales growth ahead of profit in a weak economy.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The U.S. military evacuated American government personnel from Khartoum, President Joe Biden said on Saturday, adding that Washington is suspending operations at its embassy there as fighting between Sudan's rival commanders continued.
"This tragic violence in Sudan has already cost the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians," Biden said in a statement. "It's unconscionable and it must stop."
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that "all U.S. personnel and their dependents" have been safely evacuated and that the U.S. will continue to assist Americans in Sudan in planning for their own safety.
All U.S. government personnel and a small number of diplomatic personnel from other countries were evacuated in the operation, which removed fewer than 100 people, U.S. officials said.
Just over 100 U.S. special operations forces were involved in the evacuation, entering and exiting Sudan without being fired upon by the warring factions on the ground, U.S. military officials said.
Other foreign nationals began evacuating from a Red Sea port in Sudan on Saturday. Japan's TBS news reported that the United Nations staff members including Japanese nationals and their families would be evacuated from Sudan as early as Sunday.
The bloody onslaught of urban warfare has trapped large numbers in the Sudanese capital, disabling the airport and rendering some roads impassable.
The U.N. and foreign states have urged rival military leaders to honour declared ceasefires that have mostly been ignored, and to open safe passage for fleeing civilians and the supply of badly needed aid.
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers, four years after the overthrow of long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a popular uprising.
With the airport closed and skies unsafe, thousands of foreigners - including embassy staff, aid workers and students in Khartoum and elsewhere in Africa's third largest country - have also been unable to get out.
Saudi Arabia has evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.
'HOURS OF TERROR'
Western countries are expected to send planes for their citizens from Djibouti, though the Sudanese army has said airports in Khartoum and Darfur's biggest city, Nyala, are problematic and it was not clear when that might be possible.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the rival RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily since hostilities broke out on April 15.
Saturday's fighting breached what was meant to be a three-day truce from Friday to allow citizens to reach safety and visit family during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Each side accused the other of not respecting the truce.
"I don't have a problem with the ceasefire," Hemedti told Al Arabiya TV late on Saturday. The army "did not respect it. If they respect it, so will we."
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Residents of Khartoum and the adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri reported air strikes near the state broadcaster and battles in several areas including near the army headquarters.
One Bahri resident said there had been no water or electricity for a week and frequent air strikes. "We are waiting for the big fight. We are terrified of what's coming," she said, messaging later: "It's started."
TV feeds showed a huge cloud of black smoke rising from Khartoum airport.
Medecins Sans Frontieres appealed for safe passage. "We need ports of entry where we can bring specialist trauma staff and medical supplies," said Abdalla Hussein, Sudan operations manager for the medical charity.
The Sudanese doctors union said more than two-thirds of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service, with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in crossfire.
HUMANITARIAN RISK
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region that suffered a conflict which escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.
A U.N. update on Saturday said looters had taken at least 10 World Food Programme vehicles and six other food trucks after overrunning the agency's offices and warehouses in Nyala, south Darfur.
There has been no sign that either side can secure a quick victory or is ready to talk. The army has air power but the RSF is widely embedded in urban areas.
Burhan said on Saturday that "we all need to sit as Sudanese and find the right way out to return hope and life," his most conciliatory comments since fighting began.
Earlier in the clashes, he declared the RSF a rebel force, ordered it to be disbanded, and said a military solution was the only option. Hemedti said on Saturday he could not negotiate with Burhan.
Since Bashir's overthrow and after a 2021 coup, Burhan and Hemedti held the top positions on a ruling council that was meant to hand over to civilian rule and merge the RSF into the army.
The World Health Organization reported on Friday that 413 people had been killed and 3,551 injured since fighting broke out. The death toll includes at least five aid workers in a country reliant on food aid.

(Reuters) - British chipmaker Arm Ltd is building its own semiconductor to showcase the capabilities of its products, as it seeks to attract new customers and fuel growth following its Initial Public Offering (IPO) later this year, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
Arm will team up with manufacturing partners to develop the new semiconductor, FT said, citing people briefed on the move, adding that the company has built a new "solutions engineering" team that will lead the development of these prototype chips for mobile devices, laptops and other electronics.
The SoftBank Group Corp-backed company's newest chip, on which it started work in the past six months, is "more advanced" than ever before, FT said, citing industry executives.
The chip designer has no plans to sell or license the product and is only working on a prototype, FT said.
Arm is a major supplier of intellectual property to many chip companies, especially in mobile phones and has partnerships with major chip contract manufacturers.
Earlier this month, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) said it will work with Arm to ensure that mobile phone chips and other products that use Arm's technology can be made in Intel's factories.
Arm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -The United States said it had evacuated its embassy staff from Sudan, but planned evacuations by some other countries appeared to face problems on Sunday amid battles between rival military factions that have triggered a humanitarian crisis.
Sudan's warring army and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group accused each other of attacking a convoy of French nationals, both saying one French person was wounded. France's Foreign Ministry, which had earlier said it was evacuating diplomatic staff and citizens, did not comment on the reports.
The army also accused the RSF of attacking and looting a Qatari convoy heading to Port Sudan. Doha released no immediate statement on any incident.
Egypt said a member of its mission in Sudan had been wounded by a gunshot, without giving details.
President Joe Biden said the U.S. was temporarily suspending operations at its embassy in Khartoum but remained committed to the Sudanese people, reiterating calls for a ceasefire that have so far gone largely unheeded.
"The belligerent parties must implement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and respect the will of the people of Sudan," Biden said in a statement.
Live TV feeds showed thick smoke still hanging over the capital, Khartoum, and its sister cities of Bahri and Ombdurman, as gunfire continued to ring out in some areas, a Reuters reporter said.
The fighting erupted in Khartoum and other parts of the country on April 15, four years after long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir was toppled during a popular uprising, and has killed more than 400 people.
It pits Sudan's army against the RSF, who jointly staged a coup in 2021 but fell out during negotiations over a plan to form a civilian government and integrate the RSF into the armed forces.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily, including a three-day truce for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which began on Friday.
Intense fighting has continued around the army's headquarters in central Khartoum and the airport, which has been closed by the clashes, and over the past two days in Bahri, where the army has used troops on the ground as well as air strikes to try to push back the RSF.
The RSF said on Sunday that its forces were targeted by air strikes in Bahri's Kafouri district and that dozens were "killed and injured".
"We strongly condemn this treacherous behaviour, which is inconsistent with the declared commitment to the 72-hour truce," the RSF said in a statement.
CHINOOKS
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare has dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers.
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Diplomats and foreign nationals have also struggled to find a way out.
U.S. officials said special forces using aircraft including MH-47 Chinook helicopters swept into Sudan's battle-stricken capital on Saturday from a U.S. base in Djibouti, spending just one hour on the ground to bring out fewer than 100 people.
"We did not take any small-arms fire on the way in and were able to get in and out without issue," said Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of operations at the military's Joint Staff.
Chris Maier, an assistant secretary of defense, said the U.S. military might use drone or satellite imagery to detect threats to Americans travelling on overland routes out of Sudan, or position naval assets at the Port of Sudan to aid Americans arriving there.
Under Secretary of State for Management John Bass said some Americans and other nationals had successfully travelled by land from Khartoum to Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which he said appeared to be a challenging journey given the lack of fuel, food and predictably available water.
Saudi Arabia has already evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.
Egypt, which has more than 10,000 citizens in Sudan, urged its nationals outside Khartoum to head to its consulate in Port Sudan, and to a consular office in Wadi Halfa on the border with Egypt, in preparation for their evacuation. It encouraged those in Khartoum to shelter in place and wait for the situation to improve.
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region bordering Chad that suffered a conflict that escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.

PARIS (Reuters) - France and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania expressed dismay after China's ambassador in Paris questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet countries like Ukraine.
Asked about his position on whether Crimea is part of Ukraine or not, Chinese ambassador Lu Shaye said in an interview aired on French television on Friday that historically it was part of Russia and had been offered to Ukraine by former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
"These ex-USSR countries don't have actual status in international law because there is no international agreement to materialize their sovereign status," Shaye added.
France responded on Sunday by stating its "full solidarity" with all the allied countries affected, which it said had acquired their independence "after decades of oppression".
"On Ukraine specifically, it was internationally recognized within borders including Crimea in 1991 by the entire international community, including China," a foreign ministry spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added that China will have to clarify whether these comments reflect its position or not.
The three Baltic states, all formerly part of the Soviet Union, reacted along the same lines as France.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, the wife of Britain's Prince Harry, criticised the British media on Saturday over reports that letters exchanged with King Charles played a part behind her decision not to attend his coronation, her latest confrontation with the press.
The Daily Telegraph reported Meghan had written to the now king to express her concerns about unconscious bias in the royal family. It said the letter was sent following her 2021 comments in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that the family had raised concerns about how dark her son's skin would be.
It reported the Duchess of Sussex did not feel she had received a satisfactory response to her concerns.
"The Duchess of Sussex is going about her life in the present, not thinking about correspondence from two years ago related to conversations from four years ago," a spokesperson for Meghan said.
"Any suggestion otherwise is false and frankly ridiculous. We encourage tabloid media and various royal correspondents to stop the exhausting circus that they alone are creating."
Prince Harry will attend the coronation next month without Meghan, who will remain in California with the couple's two young children. Their eldest, Archie, turns four on the same day.
Harry and Meghan stepped down from royal duties in March 2020, saying they wanted to make new lives in the United States away from media harassment.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The U.S. military evacuated American government personnel from Khartoum, President Joe Biden said on Saturday, adding that Washington is suspending operations at its embassy there as fighting between Sudan's rival commanders continued.
"This tragic violence in Sudan has already cost the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians," Biden said in a statement. "It's unconscionable and it must stop."
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that "all U.S. personnel and their dependents" have been safely evacuated and that the U.S. will continue to assist Americans in Sudan in planning for their own safety.
All U.S. government personnel and a small number of diplomatic personnel from other countries were evacuated in the operation, which removed fewer than 100 people, U.S. officials said.
Just over 100 U.S. special operations forces were involved in the evacuation, entering and exiting Sudan without being fired upon by the warring factions on the ground, U.S. military officials said.
Other foreign nationals began evacuating from a Red Sea port in Sudan on Saturday. Japan's TBS news reported that the United Nations staff members including Japanese nationals and their families would be evacuated from Sudan as early as Sunday.
The bloody onslaught of urban warfare has trapped large numbers in the Sudanese capital, disabling the airport and rendering some roads impassable.
The U.N. and foreign states have urged rival military leaders to honour declared ceasefires that have mostly been ignored, and to open safe passage for fleeing civilians and the supply of badly needed aid.
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers, four years after the overthrow of long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a popular uprising.
With the airport closed and skies unsafe, thousands of foreigners - including embassy staff, aid workers and students in Khartoum and elsewhere in Africa's third largest country - have also been unable to get out.
Saudi Arabia has evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.
'HOURS OF TERROR'
Western countries are expected to send planes for their citizens from Djibouti, though the Sudanese army has said airports in Khartoum and Darfur's biggest city, Nyala, are problematic and it was not clear when that might be possible.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the rival RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily since hostilities broke out on April 15.
Saturday's fighting breached what was meant to be a three-day truce from Friday to allow citizens to reach safety and visit family during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Each side accused the other of not respecting the truce.
"I don't have a problem with the ceasefire," Hemedti told Al Arabiya TV late on Saturday. The army "did not respect it. If they respect it, so will we."
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Residents of Khartoum and the adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri reported air strikes near the state broadcaster and battles in several areas including near the army headquarters.
One Bahri resident said there had been no water or electricity for a week and frequent air strikes. "We are waiting for the big fight. We are terrified of what's coming," she said, messaging later: "It's started."
TV feeds showed a huge cloud of black smoke rising from Khartoum airport.
Medecins Sans Frontieres appealed for safe passage. "We need ports of entry where we can bring specialist trauma staff and medical supplies," said Abdalla Hussein, Sudan operations manager for the medical charity.
The Sudanese doctors union said more than two-thirds of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service, with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in crossfire.
HUMANITARIAN RISK
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region that suffered a conflict which escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.
A U.N. update on Saturday said looters had taken at least 10 World Food Programme vehicles and six other food trucks after overrunning the agency's offices and warehouses in Nyala, south Darfur.
There has been no sign that either side can secure a quick victory or is ready to talk. The army has air power but the RSF is widely embedded in urban areas.
Burhan said on Saturday that "we all need to sit as Sudanese and find the right way out to return hope and life," his most conciliatory comments since fighting began.
Earlier in the clashes, he declared the RSF a rebel force, ordered it to be disbanded, and said a military solution was the only option. Hemedti said on Saturday he could not negotiate with Burhan.
Since Bashir's overthrow and after a 2021 coup, Burhan and Hemedti held the top positions on a ruling council that was meant to hand over to civilian rule and merge the RSF into the army.
The World Health Organization reported on Friday that 413 people had been killed and 3,551 injured since fighting broke out. The death toll includes at least five aid workers in a country reliant on food aid.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - All U.S. government personnel were evacuated from Washington's embassy in Khartoum, as well as a small number of diplomatic personnel from other countries, U.S. officials said on Saturday, as fighting rocks Sudan.
The operation evacuated fewer than 100 people, the officials told reporters.
"We evacuated all of the U.S. personnel and dependents assigned to Embassy Khartoum," said Under Secretary of State for Management John Bass.
A substantial number of local staff remain in Khartoum supporting the embassy, where Washington decided to suspend operations on Saturday due to the security risks, Bass said.
Forces commanded by two previously allied leaders of Sudan's ruling council began a violent power struggle last weekend. Washington on Saturday repeatedly called on the parties to extend and expand a ceasefire for the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday to a sustainable cessation of hostilities.
Each side has accused the other of not respecting the truce.
The evacuation operation conducted on Saturday involved just over 100 U.S. special operations forces and began at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) when U.S. aircraft, including three MH-47 Chinook transport helicopters, took off from a U.S. base in Djibouti, stopped in Ethiopia to refuel, then flew the last three hours to Khartoum.
    U.S. forces spent just an hour on the ground in Sudan before taking off again, entering and exiting Sudan without being fired upon by the warring factions on the ground, the military said.
    "We did not take any small-arms fire on the way in and were able to get in and out without issue," said Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of operations at the military's Joint Staff.
The U.S. does not anticipate the security situation in the country changing in the near term, Bass said, adding that Washington does not foresee coordinating a U.S. government evacuation of American citizens in Sudan now or in coming days.
The U.S. military is looking at options to offer Americans some assistance exiting Sudan, while stopping short of a U.S. government-led evacuation, like the one it carried out in Afghanistan in 2021. 
    Chris Maier, an assistant secretary of defense, said the U.S. military might use drone or satellite imagery to detect threats to Americans traveling on overland routes out of Sudan, or position naval assets at the Port of Sudan to aid Americans arriving there.
Bass said some Americans and other nationals had successfully traveled by land from Khartoum to Port Sudan, which he said appeared to be a challenging journey given the lack of fuel, food and predictably available water.
While the State Department is not recommending or advising people to take that route, he said they would be looking for ways to help them make the journey.
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee said Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed offered the full support of the country, which neighbors Sudan and Djibouti, for overflight and refueling capabilities in the evacuation operation.
Washington has worked to repair relations with Addis Ababa that were strained by a two-year war in the northern region of Ethiopia.

(Reuters) - Russia said on Saturday it was expelling more than 20 German diplomats in a tit-for-tat move. Germany did not immediately confirm any expulsions of its own, but said the arrival of a Russian government plane in Berlin was connected to the issue. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said Germany had decided to expel more than 20 Russians.
FIGHTING
* At least five Russian missiles hit the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and surrounding districts late on Saturday night, causing some damage to civilian buildings, local officials said.
* Russia's Defence Ministry said on Saturday that Russian assault troops had captured three more districts in the western part of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Ukrainian and Russian units have been battling for months over the eastern city, much of which lies in ruins.
* Units from Belarus returned home from Russia on Saturday after training on how to use the Iskander tactical missile system to launch nuclear weapons, the Belarusian defence ministry said.
ECONOMY
* The Group of Seven (G7) economic powers called on Sunday for the "extension, full implementation and expansion" of a critical deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea. Russia has strongly signalled that it will not allow the deal to continue beyond May 18.
* A first batch of Russian fertilizer which Latvia seized last year is being shipped to Kenya by the United Nations' World Food Programme, Latvia's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
Russia has cited the seizure as a key stumbling block to its continued participation in the Black Sea grains deal.
* Russia's richest people added $152 billion to their wealth over the past year, helped by high prices for natural resources - rebounding from the huge losses they experienced after the start of the war in Ukraine, Forbes Russia said.
RUSSIAN OFFICIAL'S SON
* The son of Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said in an interview published on Saturday that he had served in Ukraine under an assumed name as an artilleryman in the Wagner mercenary force, the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reported. Nikolai Peskov, the 33-year-old son of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, told the privately-owned newspaper that he had served in Ukraine, a rare, public example of the son of a senior Russian official fighting in the war.
DIPLOMACY
* France and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania expressed dismay after China's ambassador in Paris questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet countries like Ukraine.
* Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Saturday he did not want to "please anyone" with his views about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, after provoking criticism in the West for suggesting Kyiv shared the blame for the war.
* Russia is advising citizens to avoid travel to Canada, citing what it calls numerous cases of discrimination against Russians, including physical violence, its foreign ministry said on Saturday.
WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATIONS
* Ukraine plans to deploy software from U.S. data analytics provider Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) Inc to help it prosecute alleged war crimes committed by Russia, the company told Reuters.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla's market share in its key California market tumbled in the first quarter of the year despite aggressive price cuts as rivals stepped up, data showed on Friday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc controlled 59.6% of the battery electric market in California from January to March, down from 72.7% for all of 2022 and the lowest since 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the California Energy Commission.
Rivals such as Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet and Kia Corp increased their market shares in California during the period, although they remain in the single digits each.
Tesla's sales in California accounted for 16% of the automaker's global deliveries last year, according to Reuters calculation. California is the biggest U.S. state for zero emission vehicles.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter and embrace of Republicans has sparked concerns about Tesla's brand, especially in liberal states like California.
Tesla has been slashing prices in the United States since January, cutting prices six times in the key market.
The price cuts, which were also carried out in China, Europe and other countries, hit Tesla's first-quarter margins, pushing its shares down nearly 10% on Thursday.
Musk this week signaled the EV maker would prioritize sales growth ahead of profit in a weak economy.

(Reuters) - British chipmaker Arm Ltd is building its own semiconductor to showcase the capabilities of its products, as it seeks to attract new customers and fuel growth following its Initial Public Offering (IPO) later this year, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
Arm will team up with manufacturing partners to develop the new semiconductor, FT said, citing people briefed on the move, adding that the company has built a new "solutions engineering" team that will lead the development of these prototype chips for mobile devices, laptops and other electronics.
The SoftBank Group Corp-backed company's newest chip, on which it started work in the past six months, is "more advanced" than ever before, FT said, citing industry executives.
The chip designer has no plans to sell or license the product and is only working on a prototype, FT said.
Arm is a major supplier of intellectual property to many chip companies, especially in mobile phones and has partnerships with major chip contract manufacturers.
Earlier this month, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) said it will work with Arm to ensure that mobile phone chips and other products that use Arm's technology can be made in Intel's factories.
Arm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Investing.com - Looks like oil bears are defying OPEC+ again. And looks like OPEC+ will do the predictable thing again.
Crude prices had their first weekly decline in five as persistent U.S. rate hike and recession fears ended a rally in place since the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their 10 independent allies steered by Russia devised an output maneuver to rescue the market from 15-month lows.
The price move in the just-ended week wasn’t too large, with the drop being less than 6% — versus the four previous weeks when WTI rallied a total of 24% and Brent 18%.
What stood out about this decline was WTI’s return to below $80 a barrel by Friday’s close. Technical analysts say the U.S. crude benchmark still has a gap that needs to be filled between its March 31 settlement of $75.67 and the April 3 open of $80.10. That means WTI could drop to mid-$70 in the coming week, which could be another bearish week for oil before the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate decision on May 3.
If WTI gets to $75 or below, Brent, which trades at a $5 premium to the U.S. benchmark, risks dipping beneath the $80 mark too. This could again raise the ire of OPEC+. But is it all of OPEC+ that we need to be concerned about? Or is it just one name within the alliance?
Let's examine, beginning with Russia. The truth is Russia really doesn’t need to sell oil at $80 a barrel or more. Sure, the G7’s $60 per barrel cap on Urals crude is annoying to Vladimir Putin — both from a sovereign point and the negative impact it has in funding the Russian president's occupation of Ukraine.
Even so, with the G7, the powers within the Kremlin are realistic about what they’re up against: an entire global network of oil shippers, tanker insurers, issuers of letters of credit (i.e. banks) and other service providers who have no choice but to follow the dictates of the U.S. Treasury, or be sanctioned themselves.
As such, Moscow is content to supply as many barrels as necessary to willing customers (read: Indians and Chinese) at prices that work for both buyer/seller. And until a month ago at least, those prices were at or below the G7 cap.
The price Russia has paid on the West’s sanctions is, however, debatable.
According to Russian government data, revenue from oil and gas rose by 28%, or 2,500 billion rubles, in 2022. Converted, that comes to a neat $36.7 billion. Arguably, that spike was the result of the net increase in crude prices before the G7 price cap came into force in December last year. Global benchmark Brent went from just over $77 a barrel in December 2021 to a 14-year high above $139 in March 2022, right after the Ukraine invasion. After a selloff in the third quarter triggered by softer demand and growth worry, Brent finished last year at under $86.
Notwithstanding the G7 price cap, the West’s actions against Russia turned out to be manna from heaven for Indian oil importers and refiners, who imported record numbers of barrels from Russia at fire-sale prices, rebranded them as Indian oil and resold them at a premium.
The buyers included some of the same G7 nations, which knew only too well what was going on. It was what Washington desired anyway: The world should not be deprived of Russian oil, which is critical to a market already squeezed by OPEC cuts and other production outages. Also, the Biden administration’s aim was to throttle funding for Putin’s war in Ukraine and the price cap appears to have started doing that, the White House said.
So, price elasticity in oil is something that not just Russia but most countries within the OPEC+ alliance have learned to accept, even if they grumble about budget shortfalls from oil revenue.
Four of the Arab region’s most prolific oil producers, from second largest Iraq to the other three in respective order — the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iran — have all learned to adjust and tighten their belts when needed; except for one: Saudi Arabia.
At a time the world economy is contracting, Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman — often cryptically referred to by his initials MbS — is plunging $7 trillion into a redevelopment plan to diversify Saudi Arabia away from its oil economy. Called Vision 2030 and centered around a futuristic work-play-and-live hub called Neom, the seemingly noble plan mooted five years ago is today high in grandiosity and low on delivery. And MbS expects the rest of the world to pay for that through the Saudi hegemony of OPEC+.
The main reason OPEC+ went down the path of a second production cut announcement in four months — the first to reduce 2.0 million barrels per day was made only in November before another to take off another 1.7 million daily came in April— was to fulfill the Saudi need for $80 or more oil, which some say is critical to finance Neom, regardless what happens to the world economy.
To hear the Wall Street Journal put it, MbS “is in the midst of a plan to use his country’s gusher of oil revenue to transform its economy, rework its landscape and upend its conservative culture.” The report adds: “As prices hit $100 a barrel last year, the kingdom accelerated plans for its so-called giga-projects, which include a new city in the desert, as well as Red Sea resorts and a built-from-scratch tourism industry.”
Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman — MbS’ half brother — had promised last year to act quickly if he saw the oil market turning in the wrong direction. The back-to-back announcement of production cuts totaling 3.7 million barrels per day was apparently to fix that “wrong”, when one can argue the market was acting rightly given the concerns of demand in a recession.
“OPEC+ pre-emptive action may have been taken on accurate assumptions [that] the economy and demand … will not propel the price back above $100,” Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said on Friday.
According to OPEC+, seven of the 23 nations in the alliance — about a third of the group — will contribute to the new cuts, negotiated primarily between the Saudis and Russians to get ahead of a global slowdown. Russia, on its part, said it will extend till the end of the year the 500,000 barrels per day of cuts it pledged in March. The Saudis pledged an additional 500,000 barrels daily on top of what they claimed they were already cutting, with UAE promising 144,000, Kuwait 128,000, Oman 40,000 and Algeria 48,000. Kazakhstan — already in the news at that time over an exports blockade — pledged 78,000 barrels.
The Wall Street Journal also said Saudi Arabia wants higher crude prices to help “replenish Russia’s reserves”. That, of course, is utter fertilizer. Russian oil reserves don’t need Saudi bolstering. As the world’s biggest oil exporter, the Saudis have benefited even more from the Ukraine war than India. They, of course, did their bit for Russia too with their declaration that OPEC was apolitical and, therefore, could not condemn or would not act against Moscow over the invasion — an interesting position given that oil itself is the most politicized commodity.
The real problem with OPEC+’s production cuts — I call them maneuvers — is that like the Neom project, they are high on promise and low on stats. The original OPEC group, through most of its six decades, had a history of over-pledging and under-delivering on cuts. While the alliance achieved over-compliance on promised cuts in the aftermath of the 2020 coronavirus breakout, experts say that was more a result of battered demand that led to minimal production, rather than a will to cut barrels as pledged.
What OPEC+ is doing is using the power of the megaphone: Announce a cut, get a huge positive impact on prices, then produce what it really wants.
And if one thinks it through, it’s really quite simple to understand the OPEC+ mindset: No producer will turn away a buyer who wants more oil because the buyer will simply go to another source. With demand back at 2019 levels, almost every producer has been maxing output while publicly proclaiming adherence to production cuts.
By June though, global summer for oil is expected to accelerate, with or without production cuts. OPEC+ will simply raise output then, probably without any drama, while giving the appearance that it was still cutting the millions of barrels per day that it had pledged.
Should crude prices still totter at $70 levels or below at that time over recession worries, we know what the Saudis will do as the June 3 OPEC+ meeting approaches. The reality is MbS might not even wait till then — ordering his half-brother to take any arbitrary decision that can be dressed up later as a consensus — to push the market higher.
Oil: Market Settlements and Activity
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate for June delivery settled at $77.87 — up 50 cents, or 0.6%, on the day — as per CME data. For the week, June WTI was down 5.6% from the April 14 settlement of $82.52 for the front month contract.
On Investing.com, WTI for June delivery showed a final post-settlement trade of $77.95, as per capital.com data.
June Brent officially settled Friday’s trade at $81.66 — up 56 cents, or 0.7% — as per CME data. For the week, the global crude benchmark fell 5.4%.
London-traded Brent for June delivery showed a final trade of $81.75 per barrel on Investing.com in data published by capital.com.
Oil: Price Outlook
If oil bears attempt to force WTI to fill its April 3 gap of $75.67, Friday’s settlement of $77.87 for the June contract will first be dragged down to $77 and then be set up for a retest of the $75.80 support, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.
“After four weeks of strong positive action, WTI has fallen almost 6% for the first time in a week,” Dixit noted. “The weekly stochastics at 69/84 makes a negative overlap while RSI at 48 is positioned below neutrality of 50.”
“Major downside potential is seen at $73.80,” he added.
On the flip side, he said June WTI could move back towards $79.50, above which the 200-Day Simple Moving Average of $82.40 remains a strong resistance.”
Gold: Market Settlements and Activity
The most-active June gold futures contract on New York’s Comex settled Friday’s trade down $28.60, or 1.4%, at $1,990.50. The session bottom for June gold was $1,982.35. Since its run to a more than three year high of $2,048.60 on April 13, Comex’s most-active gold contract has lost almost 3%. For the current week, it was down 0.6%, after last week’s slide of 0.5%.
On Investing.com, gold for June delivery showed a final post-settlement trade of $1,994.10, as per capital.com data.
The spot price of gold, which reflects physical trades in bullion and is more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled down $21.17, or 1.1%, at $1,983.64. For the week, it was also down 1%.
The latest weekly decline in gold began after the Dollar Index and U.S. Treasury yields rebounded from the one-year lows hit last week. Gold is a direct contrarian trade to the dollar. Besides that, a higher dollar tends to weigh on overseas demand for commodities priced in the currency. Higher Treasury yields also sap the appeal of risk-heavy assets, while also limiting flows of foreign capital into the United States.
A relatively softer dollar in the past 24 hours, however, did not help gold.
Still, weighing on gold were concerns that the Federal Reserve will agree on another quarter point increase at its May 3rd rate decision which will bring U.S. interest rates to a peak of 5.25% — versus the pandemic-era rate of just 0.25%.
“Gold remains choppy as we near the end of the week,” said OANDA's analyst Erlam. “Uncertainty over the path of interest rates, which should become much clearer over the next month or two, is driving the indecision we're seeing in gold at the moment.”
While Erlam noted that higher Treasury yields had stalled the rally in the yellow metal, “traders are clearly in no mood to give up on the yellow metal.”
“As things stand, dips are being bought and it will be interesting to see if we see the same on this occasion as well,” he added. “Big support remains around $1,940-$1,960.”
Gold: Price Outlook
Dixit of SKCharting said an upward rebound in gold will require a strong breakout above the 5-Day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, of $1,996 and a horizontal resistance zone of $2,015 to retest the swing high of $2,048.
“Going forward into the week ahead, if the Dollar Index breaks and sustains above $109.95, we are likely to witness the dollar gaining further upside towards the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $103.10, followed by the 50-week EMA of $103.65,” said Dixit. “This may push gold lower towards the Fibonacci level of $1,955. In the event of any extended weakness, gold could even get to the 50-day EMA of $1,943.”
Natural Gas: Market Settlements and Activity
Natural gas bulls aren’t making much progress beyond the mid $2 level, but a second weekly win of 5% might assure those long on America’s favorite fuel for indoor temperature control that a price breakout could be imminent.
The most-active May gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled down 1.6 cents, or 0.7%, at $2.221 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units. For the week though, May gas was up 5.1%, mirroring last week’s run-up.
On Investing.com, gas for delivery in May shows a final post-settlement trade of $2.22, as per capital.com data.
The debate on when the bearish tide would irrevocably turn for ‘natty’ — as the all-season fuel for indoor heating and cooling is known — has raged since gas prices began their headlong fall from 14-year highs of $10 in August to crash to 2-1/2 year lows beneath $2.
At brief intervals over the past two months, the market had appeared to be on the cusp of a serious rebound — like in late February when it got above $3 after breaking below $2 earlier that month for the first time since September 2020.
This week, again, such a phenomenon appeared when the front-month May gas contract rallied to almost $2.40 — a level it had not reached since late March — exciting traders and analysts over the prospect of $3 pricing and beyond.
Friday’s slide in gas prices came as investor focus returned to the abysmal state of U.S. gas inventories held in storage, after one of the warmest winters on record.
Gas storage for the week ended April 14 rose by 75 billion cubic feet, or bcf, after all the burning done for power generation as well as for heating as some unexpected chill for this time of the year surfaced, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reported.
That 75-bcf injection bumped up total gas inventories to 1.930 trillion cubic feet, or tcf, EIA records showed. At current levels, the gas storage stands at 34% above the year-ago level of 1.442 tcf and nearly 21% higher than the five-year average of 1.601 tcf.
In the short term, Henry Hub prices could continue to recover in the higher $2 trajectory, said analysts at Houston-based energy markets advisory Gelber & Associates.
“Weather forecasts from major weather models still show a cold front coming through in the coming days, leading to colder than average end of April and beginning of May,” Gelber’s analysts said in a note issued on Friday to the firm’s natural gas clients. “This cold front is expected to increase weather-driven demand to high levels.”
But the mid-term outlook remained cloudy, the note said.
“Overall, the market still has way too much supply for these small weather runs to significantly affect the supply/demand balance,” Gelber’s analysts added.
Natural gas: Price Outlook
In what seems to be a flattening bottom which is still too early to be confirmed, natural gas futures closed above the 5-week EMA for a second time, noted Dixit of SKCharting.
“If breakout from the descending channel withstands bearish pressure, clearing through the 50-day EMA dynamically positioned at $2.52 will be an immediate challenge,” he said. “This may extend the upward move towards swing high to $3.03.”
A break below the daily Middle Bollinger Band of $2.15 may begin some decline towards the small gap left at $2.11 and extend that towards $2.04, Dixit added.

By Khalid Abdelaziz
KHARTOUM (Reuters) -The United States said it had evacuated its embassy staff from Sudan, but planned evacuations by some other countries appeared to face problems on Sunday amid battles between rival military factions that have triggered a humanitarian crisis.
Sudan's warring army and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group accused each other of attacking a convoy of French nationals, both saying one French person was wounded. France's Foreign Ministry, which had earlier said it was evacuating diplomatic staff and citizens, did not comment on the reports.
The army also accused the RSF of attacking and looting a Qatari convoy heading to Port Sudan. Doha released no immediate statement on any incident.
Egypt said a member of its mission in Sudan had been wounded by a gunshot, without giving details.
President Joe Biden said the U.S. was temporarily suspending operations at its embassy in Khartoum but remained committed to the Sudanese people, reiterating calls for a ceasefire that have so far gone largely unheeded.
"The belligerent parties must implement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and respect the will of the people of Sudan," Biden said in a statement.
Live TV feeds showed thick smoke still hanging over the capital, Khartoum, and its sister cities of Bahri and Ombdurman, as gunfire continued to ring out in some areas, a Reuters reporter said.
The fighting erupted in Khartoum and other parts of the country on April 15, four years after long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir was toppled during a popular uprising, and has killed more than 400 people.
It pits Sudan's army against the RSF, who jointly staged a coup in 2021 but fell out during negotiations over a plan to form a civilian government and integrate the RSF into the armed forces.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily, including a three-day truce for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which began on Friday.
Intense fighting has continued around the army's headquarters in central Khartoum and the airport, which has been closed by the clashes, and over the past two days in Bahri, where the army has used troops on the ground as well as air strikes to try to push back the RSF.
The RSF said on Sunday that its forces were targeted by air strikes in Bahri's Kafouri district and that dozens were "killed and injured".
"We strongly condemn this treacherous behaviour, which is inconsistent with the declared commitment to the 72-hour truce," the RSF said in a statement.
CHINOOKS
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare has dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers.
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Diplomats and foreign nationals have also struggled to find a way out.
U.S. officials said special forces using aircraft including MH-47 Chinook helicopters swept into Sudan's battle-stricken capital on Saturday from a U.S. base in Djibouti, spending just one hour on the ground to bring out fewer than 100 people.
"We did not take any small-arms fire on the way in and were able to get in and out without issue," said Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of operations at the military's Joint Staff.
Chris Maier, an assistant secretary of defense, said the U.S. military might use drone or satellite imagery to detect threats to Americans travelling on overland routes out of Sudan, or position naval assets at the Port of Sudan to aid Americans arriving there.
Under Secretary of State for Management John Bass said some Americans and other nationals had successfully travelled by land from Khartoum to Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which he said appeared to be a challenging journey given the lack of fuel, food and predictably available water.
Saudi Arabia has already evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.
Egypt, which has more than 10,000 citizens in Sudan, urged its nationals outside Khartoum to head to its consulate in Port Sudan, and to a consular office in Wadi Halfa on the border with Egypt, in preparation for their evacuation. It encouraged those in Khartoum to shelter in place and wait for the situation to improve.
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region bordering Chad that suffered a conflict that escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.

PARIS (Reuters) - France and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania expressed dismay after China's ambassador in Paris questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet countries like Ukraine.
Asked about his position on whether Crimea is part of Ukraine or not, Chinese ambassador Lu Shaye said in an interview aired on French television on Friday that historically it was part of Russia and had been offered to Ukraine by former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
"These ex-USSR countries don't have actual status in international law because there is no international agreement to materialize their sovereign status," Shaye added.
France responded on Sunday by stating its "full solidarity" with all the allied countries affected, which it said had acquired their independence "after decades of oppression".
"On Ukraine specifically, it was internationally recognized within borders including Crimea in 1991 by the entire international community, including China," a foreign ministry spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added that China will have to clarify whether these comments reflect its position or not.
The three Baltic states, all formerly part of the Soviet Union, reacted along the same lines as France.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, the wife of Britain's Prince Harry, criticised the British media on Saturday over reports that letters exchanged with King Charles played a part behind her decision not to attend his coronation, her latest confrontation with the press.
The Daily Telegraph reported Meghan had written to the now king to express her concerns about unconscious bias in the royal family. It said the letter was sent following her 2021 comments in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that the family had raised concerns about how dark her son's skin would be.
It reported the Duchess of Sussex did not feel she had received a satisfactory response to her concerns.
"The Duchess of Sussex is going about her life in the present, not thinking about correspondence from two years ago related to conversations from four years ago," a spokesperson for Meghan said.
"Any suggestion otherwise is false and frankly ridiculous. We encourage tabloid media and various royal correspondents to stop the exhausting circus that they alone are creating."
Prince Harry will attend the coronation next month without Meghan, who will remain in California with the couple's two young children. Their eldest, Archie, turns four on the same day.
Harry and Meghan stepped down from royal duties in March 2020, saying they wanted to make new lives in the United States away from media harassment.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian police have arrested Sikh separatist Amritpal Singh after searching for him for more than a month, a state police official said on Sunday, a move against the revival of an independent homeland in the state of Punjab bordering Pakistan.
The rise of Singh, a preacher in the northwestern state of Punjab where Sikhs are in the majority, has revived talk of an independent Sikh homeland and stoked fears of a return to violence that killed tens of thousands of people in the 1980s and early 1990s during a Sikh insurgency.
"Amritpal Singh has been arrested from the Rode village in Moga district, Punjab on the basis of specific intelligence," Sukhchain Singh Gill, a top official of the Punjab police told reporters.
The arrest of Amritpal Singh, 30 -- who leads a group called Waris Punjab De (the heirs of Punjab)-- comes after the self-styled preacher and hundreds of his supporters stormed a police station with swords and firearms, demanding the release of one of his aides.
Police have accused Singh and his supporters of attempted murder, obstruction of law enforcement, and creating disharmony, and said he had been on the run since mid-March.
He was arrested in the village gurudwara, a Sikh temple, under the National Security Act, which allows for those deemed a threat to national security to be detained without charge for up to a year, the police official said.
Gill said he would be moved to Dibrugarh, in the state of Assam, where some of his associates are already in jail.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla's market share in its key California market tumbled in the first quarter of the year despite aggressive price cuts as rivals stepped up, data showed on Friday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc controlled 59.6% of the battery electric market in California from January to March, down from 72.7% for all of 2022 and the lowest since 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the California Energy Commission.
Rivals such as Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet and Kia Corp increased their market shares in California during the period, although they remain in the single digits each.
Tesla's sales in California accounted for 16% of the automaker's global deliveries last year, according to Reuters calculation. California is the biggest U.S. state for zero emission vehicles.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter and embrace of Republicans has sparked concerns about Tesla's brand, especially in liberal states like California.
Tesla has been slashing prices in the United States since January, cutting prices six times in the key market.

The price cuts, which were also carried out in China, Europe and other countries, hit Tesla's first-quarter margins, pushing its shares down nearly 10% on Thursday.
Musk this week signaled the EV maker would prioritize sales growth ahead of profit in a weak economy.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The U.S. military evacuated American government personnel from Khartoum, President Joe Biden said on Saturday, adding that Washington is suspending operations at its embassy there as fighting between Sudan's rival commanders continued.
"This tragic violence in Sudan has already cost the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians," Biden said in a statement. "It's unconscionable and it must stop."
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that "all U.S. personnel and their dependents" have been safely evacuated and that the U.S. will continue to assist Americans in Sudan in planning for their own safety.
All U.S. government personnel and a small number of diplomatic personnel from other countries were evacuated in the operation, which removed fewer than 100 people, U.S. officials said.
Just over 100 U.S. special operations forces were involved in the evacuation, entering and exiting Sudan without being fired upon by the warring factions on the ground, U.S. military officials said.
Other foreign nationals began evacuating from a Red Sea port in Sudan on Saturday. Japan's TBS news reported that the United Nations staff members including Japanese nationals and their families would be evacuated from Sudan as early as Sunday.
The bloody onslaught of urban warfare has trapped large numbers in the Sudanese capital, disabling the airport and rendering some roads impassable.
The U.N. and foreign states have urged rival military leaders to honour declared ceasefires that have mostly been ignored, and to open safe passage for fleeing civilians and the supply of badly needed aid.
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers, four years after the overthrow of long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a popular uprising.
With the airport closed and skies unsafe, thousands of foreigners - including embassy staff, aid workers and students in Khartoum and elsewhere in Africa's third largest country - have also been unable to get out.
Saudi Arabia has evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.
'HOURS OF TERROR'
Western countries are expected to send planes for their citizens from Djibouti, though the Sudanese army has said airports in Khartoum and Darfur's biggest city, Nyala, are problematic and it was not clear when that might be possible.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the rival RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily since hostilities broke out on April 15.
Saturday's fighting breached what was meant to be a three-day truce from Friday to allow citizens to reach safety and visit family during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Each side accused the other of not respecting the truce.
"I don't have a problem with the ceasefire," Hemedti told Al Arabiya TV late on Saturday. The army "did not respect it. If they respect it, so will we."
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Residents of Khartoum and the adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri reported air strikes near the state broadcaster and battles in several areas including near the army headquarters.
One Bahri resident said there had been no water or electricity for a week and frequent air strikes. "We are waiting for the big fight. We are terrified of what's coming," she said, messaging later: "It's started."
TV feeds showed a huge cloud of black smoke rising from Khartoum airport.
Medecins Sans Frontieres appealed for safe passage. "We need ports of entry where we can bring specialist trauma staff and medical supplies," said Abdalla Hussein, Sudan operations manager for the medical charity.
The Sudanese doctors union said more than two-thirds of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service, with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in crossfire.
HUMANITARIAN RISK
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region that suffered a conflict which escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.
A U.N. update on Saturday said looters had taken at least 10 World Food Programme vehicles and six other food trucks after overrunning the agency's offices and warehouses in Nyala, south Darfur.
There has been no sign that either side can secure a quick victory or is ready to talk. The army has air power but the RSF is widely embedded in urban areas.
Burhan said on Saturday that "we all need to sit as Sudanese and find the right way out to return hope and life," his most conciliatory comments since fighting began.
Earlier in the clashes, he declared the RSF a rebel force, ordered it to be disbanded, and said a military solution was the only option. Hemedti said on Saturday he could not negotiate with Burhan.

Since Bashir's overthrow and after a 2021 coup, Burhan and Hemedti held the top positions on a ruling council that was meant to hand over to civilian rule and merge the RSF into the army.
The World Health Organization reported on Friday that 413 people had been killed and 3,551 injured since fighting broke out. The death toll includes at least five aid workers in a country reliant on food aid.

Investing.com - Looks like oil bears are defying OPEC+ again. And looks like OPEC+ will do the predictable thing again.
Crude prices had their first weekly decline in five as persistent U.S. rate hike and recession fears ended a rally in place since the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their 10 independent allies steered by Russia devised an output maneuver to rescue the market from 15-month lows.
The price move in the just-ended week wasn’t too large, with the drop being less than 6% — versus the four previous weeks when WTI rallied a total of 24% and Brent 18%.
What stood out about this decline was WTI’s return to below $80 a barrel by Friday’s close. Technical analysts say the U.S. crude benchmark still has a gap that needs to be filled between its March 31 settlement of $75.67 and the April 3 open of $80.10. That means WTI could drop to mid-$70 in the coming week, which could be another bearish week for oil before the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate decision on May 3.
If WTI gets to $75 or below, Brent, which trades at a $5 premium to the U.S. benchmark, risks dipping beneath the $80 mark too. This could again raise the ire of OPEC+. But is it all of OPEC+ that we need to be concerned about? Or is it just one name within the alliance?
Let's examine, beginning with Russia. The truth is Russia really doesn’t need to sell oil at $80 a barrel or more. Sure, the G7’s $60 per barrel cap on Urals crude is annoying to Vladimir Putin — both from a sovereign point and the negative impact it has in funding the Russian president's occupation of Ukraine.
Even so, with the G7, the powers within the Kremlin are realistic about what they’re up against: an entire global network of oil shippers, tanker insurers, issuers of letters of credit (i.e. banks) and other service providers who have no choice but to follow the dictates of the U.S. Treasury, or be sanctioned themselves.
As such, Moscow is content to supply as many barrels as necessary to willing customers (read: Indians and Chinese) at prices that work for both buyer/seller. And until a month ago at least, those prices were at or below the G7 cap.
The price Russia has paid on the West’s sanctions is, however, debatable.
According to Russian government data, revenue from oil and gas rose by 28%, or 2,500 billion rubles, in 2022. Converted, that comes to a neat $36.7 billion. Arguably, that spike was the result of the net increase in crude prices before the G7 price cap came into force in December last year. Global benchmark Brent went from just over $77 a barrel in December 2021 to a 14-year high above $139 in March 2022, right after the Ukraine invasion. After a selloff in the third quarter triggered by softer demand and growth worry, Brent finished last year at under $86.
Notwithstanding the G7 price cap, the West’s actions against Russia turned out to be manna from heaven for Indian oil importers and refiners, who imported record numbers of barrels from Russia at fire-sale prices, rebranded them as Indian oil and resold them at a premium.
The buyers included some of the same G7 nations, which knew only too well what was going on. It was what Washington desired anyway: The world should not be deprived of Russian oil, which is critical to a market already squeezed by OPEC cuts and other production outages. Also, the Biden administration’s aim was to throttle funding for Putin’s war in Ukraine and the price cap appears to have started doing that, the White House said.
So, price elasticity in oil is something that not just Russia but most countries within the OPEC+ alliance have learned to accept, even if they grumble about budget shortfalls from oil revenue.
Four of the Arab region’s most prolific oil producers, from second largest Iraq to the other three in respective order — the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iran — have all learned to adjust and tighten their belts when needed; except for one: Saudi Arabia.
At a time the world economy is contracting, Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman — often cryptically referred to by his initials MbS — is plunging $7 trillion into a redevelopment plan to diversify Saudi Arabia away from its oil economy. Called Vision 2030 and centered around a futuristic work-play-and-live hub called Neom, the seemingly noble plan mooted five years ago is today high in grandiosity and low on delivery. And MbS expects the rest of the world to pay for that through the Saudi hegemony of OPEC+.
The main reason OPEC+ went down the path of a second production cut announcement in four months — the first to reduce 2.0 million barrels per day was made only in November before another to take off another 1.7 million daily came in April— was to fulfill the Saudi need for $80 or more oil, which some say is critical to finance Neom, regardless what happens to the world economy.
To hear the Wall Street Journal put it, MbS “is in the midst of a plan to use his country’s gusher of oil revenue to transform its economy, rework its landscape and upend its conservative culture.” The report adds: “As prices hit $100 a barrel last year, the kingdom accelerated plans for its so-called giga-projects, which include a new city in the desert, as well as Red Sea resorts and a built-from-scratch tourism industry.”
Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman — MbS’ half brother — had promised last year to act quickly if he saw the oil market turning in the wrong direction. The back-to-back announcement of production cuts totaling 3.7 million barrels per day was apparently to fix that “wrong”, when one can argue the market was acting rightly given the concerns of demand in a recession.
“OPEC+ pre-emptive action may have been taken on accurate assumptions [that] the economy and demand … will not propel the price back above $100,” Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said on Friday.
According to OPEC+, seven of the 23 nations in the alliance — about a third of the group — will contribute to the new cuts, negotiated primarily between the Saudis and Russians to get ahead of a global slowdown. Russia, on its part, said it will extend till the end of the year the 500,000 barrels per day of cuts it pledged in March. The Saudis pledged an additional 500,000 barrels daily on top of what they claimed they were already cutting, with UAE promising 144,000, Kuwait 128,000, Oman 40,000 and Algeria 48,000. Kazakhstan — already in the news at that time over an exports blockade — pledged 78,000 barrels.
The Wall Street Journal also said Saudi Arabia wants higher crude prices to help “replenish Russia’s reserves”. That, of course, is utter fertilizer. Russian oil reserves don’t need Saudi bolstering. As the world’s biggest oil exporter, the Saudis have benefited even more from the Ukraine war than India. They, of course, did their bit for Russia too with their declaration that OPEC was apolitical and, therefore, could not condemn or would not act against Moscow over the invasion — an interesting position given that oil itself is the most politicized commodity.
The real problem with OPEC+’s production cuts — I call them maneuvers — is that like the Neom project, they are high on promise and low on stats. The original OPEC group, through most of its six decades, had a history of over-pledging and under-delivering on cuts. While the alliance achieved over-compliance on promised cuts in the aftermath of the 2020 coronavirus breakout, experts say that was more a result of battered demand that led to minimal production, rather than a will to cut barrels as pledged.
What OPEC+ is doing is using the power of the megaphone: Announce a cut, get a huge positive impact on prices, then produce what it really wants.
And if one thinks it through, it’s really quite simple to understand the OPEC+ mindset: No producer will turn away a buyer who wants more oil because the buyer will simply go to another source. With demand back at 2019 levels, almost every producer has been maxing output while publicly proclaiming adherence to production cuts.
By June though, global summer for oil is expected to accelerate, with or without production cuts. OPEC+ will simply raise output then, probably without any drama, while giving the appearance that it was still cutting the millions of barrels per day that it had pledged.
Should crude prices still totter at $70 levels or below at that time over recession worries, we know what the Saudis will do as the June 3 OPEC+ meeting approaches. The reality is MbS might not even wait till then — ordering his half-brother to take any arbitrary decision that can be dressed up later as a consensus — to push the market higher.
Oil: Market Settlements and Activity
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate for June delivery settled at $77.87 — up 50 cents, or 0.6%, on the day — as per CME data. For the week, June WTI was down 5.6% from the April 14 settlement of $82.52 for the front month contract.
On Investing.com, WTI for June delivery showed a final post-settlement trade of $77.95, as per capital.com data.
June Brent officially settled Friday’s trade at $81.66 — up 56 cents, or 0.7% — as per CME data. For the week, the global crude benchmark fell 5.4%.
London-traded Brent for June delivery showed a final trade of $81.75 per barrel on Investing.com in data published by capital.com.
Oil: Price Outlook
If oil bears attempt to force WTI to fill its April 3 gap of $75.67, Friday’s settlement of $77.87 for the June contract will first be dragged down to $77 and then be set up for a retest of the $75.80 support, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.
“After four weeks of strong positive action, WTI has fallen almost 6% for the first time in a week,” Dixit noted. “The weekly stochastics at 69/84 makes a negative overlap while RSI at 48 is positioned below neutrality of 50.”
“Major downside potential is seen at $73.80,” he added.
On the flip side, he said June WTI could move back towards $79.50, above which the 200-Day Simple Moving Average of $82.40 remains a strong resistance.”
Gold: Market Settlements and Activity
The most-active June gold futures contract on New York’s Comex settled Friday’s trade down $28.60, or 1.4%, at $1,990.50. The session bottom for June gold was $1,982.35. Since its run to a more than three year high of $2,048.60 on April 13, Comex’s most-active gold contract has lost almost 3%. For the current week, it was down 0.6%, after last week’s slide of 0.5%.
On Investing.com, gold for June delivery showed a final post-settlement trade of $1,994.10, as per capital.com data.
The spot price of gold, which reflects physical trades in bullion and is more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled down $21.17, or 1.1%, at $1,983.64. For the week, it was also down 1%.
The latest weekly decline in gold began after the Dollar Index and U.S. Treasury yields rebounded from the one-year lows hit last week. Gold is a direct contrarian trade to the dollar. Besides that, a higher dollar tends to weigh on overseas demand for commodities priced in the currency. Higher Treasury yields also sap the appeal of risk-heavy assets, while also limiting flows of foreign capital into the United States.
A relatively softer dollar in the past 24 hours, however, did not help gold.
Still, weighing on gold were concerns that the Federal Reserve will agree on another quarter point increase at its May 3rd rate decision which will bring U.S. interest rates to a peak of 5.25% — versus the pandemic-era rate of just 0.25%.
“Gold remains choppy as we near the end of the week,” said OANDA's analyst Erlam. “Uncertainty over the path of interest rates, which should become much clearer over the next month or two, is driving the indecision we're seeing in gold at the moment.”
While Erlam noted that higher Treasury yields had stalled the rally in the yellow metal, “traders are clearly in no mood to give up on the yellow metal.”
“As things stand, dips are being bought and it will be interesting to see if we see the same on this occasion as well,” he added. “Big support remains around $1,940-$1,960.”
Gold: Price Outlook
Dixit of SKCharting said an upward rebound in gold will require a strong breakout above the 5-Day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, of $1,996 and a horizontal resistance zone of $2,015 to retest the swing high of $2,048.
“Going forward into the week ahead, if the Dollar Index breaks and sustains above $109.95, we are likely to witness the dollar gaining further upside towards the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $103.10, followed by the 50-week EMA of $103.65,” said Dixit. “This may push gold lower towards the Fibonacci level of $1,955. In the event of any extended weakness, gold could even get to the 50-day EMA of $1,943.”
Natural Gas: Market Settlements and Activity
Natural gas bulls aren’t making much progress beyond the mid $2 level, but a second weekly win of 5% might assure those long on America’s favorite fuel for indoor temperature control that a price breakout could be imminent.
The most-active May gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled down 1.6 cents, or 0.7%, at $2.221 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units. For the week though, May gas was up 5.1%, mirroring last week’s run-up.
On Investing.com, gas for delivery in May shows a final post-settlement trade of $2.22, as per capital.com data.
The debate on when the bearish tide would irrevocably turn for ‘natty’ — as the all-season fuel for indoor heating and cooling is known — has raged since gas prices began their headlong fall from 14-year highs of $10 in August to crash to 2-1/2 year lows beneath $2.
At brief intervals over the past two months, the market had appeared to be on the cusp of a serious rebound — like in late February when it got above $3 after breaking below $2 earlier that month for the first time since September 2020.
This week, again, such a phenomenon appeared when the front-month May gas contract rallied to almost $2.40 — a level it had not reached since late March — exciting traders and analysts over the prospect of $3 pricing and beyond.
Friday’s slide in gas prices came as investor focus returned to the abysmal state of U.S. gas inventories held in storage, after one of the warmest winters on record.
Gas storage for the week ended April 14 rose by 75 billion cubic feet, or bcf, after all the burning done for power generation as well as for heating as some unexpected chill for this time of the year surfaced, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reported.
That 75-bcf injection bumped up total gas inventories to 1.930 trillion cubic feet, or tcf, EIA records showed. At current levels, the gas storage stands at 34% above the year-ago level of 1.442 tcf and nearly 21% higher than the five-year average of 1.601 tcf.
In the short term, Henry Hub prices could continue to recover in the higher $2 trajectory, said analysts at Houston-based energy markets advisory Gelber & Associates.
“Weather forecasts from major weather models still show a cold front coming through in the coming days, leading to colder than average end of April and beginning of May,” Gelber’s analysts said in a note issued on Friday to the firm’s natural gas clients. “This cold front is expected to increase weather-driven demand to high levels.”
But the mid-term outlook remained cloudy, the note said.
“Overall, the market still has way too much supply for these small weather runs to significantly affect the supply/demand balance,” Gelber’s analysts added.
Natural gas: Price Outlook
In what seems to be a flattening bottom which is still too early to be confirmed, natural gas futures closed above the 5-week EMA for a second time, noted Dixit of SKCharting.
“If breakout from the descending channel withstands bearish pressure, clearing through the 50-day EMA dynamically positioned at $2.52 will be an immediate challenge,” he said. “This may extend the upward move towards swing high to $3.03.”
A break below the daily Middle Bollinger Band of $2.15 may begin some decline towards the small gap left at $2.11 and extend that towards $2.04, Dixit added.

(Reuters) - British chipmaker Arm Ltd is building its own semiconductor to showcase the capabilities of its products, as it seeks to attract new customers and fuel growth following its Initial Public Offering (IPO) later this year, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
Arm will team up with manufacturing partners to develop the new semiconductor, FT said, citing people briefed on the move, adding that the company has built a new "solutions engineering" team that will lead the development of these prototype chips for mobile devices, laptops and other electronics.
The SoftBank Group Corp-backed company's newest chip, on which it started work in the past six months, is "more advanced" than ever before, FT said, citing industry executives.
The chip designer has no plans to sell or license the product and is only working on a prototype, FT said.
Arm is a major supplier of intellectual property to many chip companies, especially in mobile phones and has partnerships with major chip contract manufacturers.

Earlier this month, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) said it will work with Arm to ensure that mobile phone chips and other products that use Arm's technology can be made in Intel's factories.
Arm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -The United States said it had evacuated its embassy staff from Sudan, but planned evacuations by some other countries appeared to face problems on Sunday amid battles between rival military factions that have triggered a humanitarian crisis.
Sudan's warring army and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group accused each other of attacking a convoy of French nationals, both saying one French person was wounded. France's Foreign Ministry, which had earlier said it was evacuating diplomatic staff and citizens, did not comment on the reports.
The army also accused the RSF of attacking and looting a Qatari convoy heading to Port Sudan. Doha released no immediate statement on any incident.
Egypt said a member of its mission in Sudan had been wounded by a gunshot, without giving details.
President Joe Biden said the U.S. was temporarily suspending operations at its embassy in Khartoum but remained committed to the Sudanese people, reiterating calls for a ceasefire that have so far gone largely unheeded.
"The belligerent parties must implement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and respect the will of the people of Sudan," Biden said in a statement.
Live TV feeds showed thick smoke still hanging over the capital, Khartoum, and its sister cities of Bahri and Ombdurman, as gunfire continued to ring out in some areas, a Reuters reporter said.
The fighting erupted in Khartoum and other parts of the country on April 15, four years after long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir was toppled during a popular uprising, and has killed more than 400 people.
It pits Sudan's army against the RSF, who jointly staged a coup in 2021 but fell out during negotiations over a plan to form a civilian government and integrate the RSF into the armed forces.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily, including a three-day truce for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which began on Friday.
Intense fighting has continued around the army's headquarters in central Khartoum and the airport, which has been closed by the clashes, and over the past two days in Bahri, where the army has used troops on the ground as well as air strikes to try to push back the RSF.
The RSF said on Sunday that its forces were targeted by air strikes in Bahri's Kafouri district and that dozens were "killed and injured".
"We strongly condemn this treacherous behaviour, which is inconsistent with the declared commitment to the 72-hour truce," the RSF said in a statement.
CHINOOKS
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare has dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers.
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Diplomats and foreign nationals have also struggled to find a way out.
U.S. officials said special forces using aircraft including MH-47 Chinook helicopters swept into Sudan's battle-stricken capital on Saturday from a U.S. base in Djibouti, spending just one hour on the ground to bring out fewer than 100 people.
"We did not take any small-arms fire on the way in and were able to get in and out without issue," said Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of operations at the military's Joint Staff.
Chris Maier, an assistant secretary of defense, said the U.S. military might use drone or satellite imagery to detect threats to Americans travelling on overland routes out of Sudan, or position naval assets at the Port of Sudan to aid Americans arriving there.
Under Secretary of State for Management John Bass said some Americans and other nationals had successfully travelled by land from Khartoum to Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which he said appeared to be a challenging journey given the lack of fuel, food and predictably available water.
Saudi Arabia has already evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.

Egypt, which has more than 10,000 citizens in Sudan, urged its nationals outside Khartoum to head to its consulate in Port Sudan, and to a consular office in Wadi Halfa on the border with Egypt, in preparation for their evacuation. It encouraged those in Khartoum to shelter in place and wait for the situation to improve.
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region bordering Chad that suffered a conflict that escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.

2023-04-23 18:57:31,969 - INFO - PARIS (Reuters) - France and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania expressed dismay after China's ambassador in Paris questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet countries like Ukraine.
Asked about his position on whether Crimea is part of Ukraine or not, Chinese ambassador Lu Shaye said in an interview aired on French television on Friday that historically it was part of Russia and had been offered to Ukraine by former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
"These ex-USSR countries don't have actual status in international law because there is no international agreement to materialize their sovereign status," Shaye added.
France responded on Sunday by stating its "full solidarity" with all the allied countries affected, which it said had acquired their independence "after decades of oppression".
"On Ukraine specifically, it was internationally recognized within borders including Crimea in 1991 by the entire international community, including China," a foreign ministry spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added that China will have to clarify whether these comments reflect its position or not.

The three Baltic states, all formerly part of the Soviet Union, reacted along the same lines as France.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The U.S. military evacuated American government personnel from Khartoum, President Joe Biden said on Saturday, adding that Washington is suspending operations at its embassy there as fighting between Sudan's rival commanders continued.
"This tragic violence in Sudan has already cost the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians," Biden said in a statement. "It's unconscionable and it must stop."
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that "all U.S. personnel and their dependents" have been safely evacuated and that the U.S. will continue to assist Americans in Sudan in planning for their own safety.
All U.S. government personnel and a small number of diplomatic personnel from other countries were evacuated in the operation, which removed fewer than 100 people, U.S. officials said.
Just over 100 U.S. special operations forces were involved in the evacuation, entering and exiting Sudan without being fired upon by the warring factions on the ground, U.S. military officials said.
Other foreign nationals began evacuating from a Red Sea port in Sudan on Saturday. Japan's TBS news reported that the United Nations staff members including Japanese nationals and their families would be evacuated from Sudan as early as Sunday.
The bloody onslaught of urban warfare has trapped large numbers in the Sudanese capital, disabling the airport and rendering some roads impassable.
The U.N. and foreign states have urged rival military leaders to honour declared ceasefires that have mostly been ignored, and to open safe passage for fleeing civilians and the supply of badly needed aid.
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers, four years after the overthrow of long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a popular uprising.
With the airport closed and skies unsafe, thousands of foreigners - including embassy staff, aid workers and students in Khartoum and elsewhere in Africa's third largest country - have also been unable to get out.
Saudi Arabia has evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.
'HOURS OF TERROR'
Western countries are expected to send planes for their citizens from Djibouti, though the Sudanese army has said airports in Khartoum and Darfur's biggest city, Nyala, are problematic and it was not clear when that might be possible.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the rival RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily since hostilities broke out on April 15.
Saturday's fighting breached what was meant to be a three-day truce from Friday to allow citizens to reach safety and visit family during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Each side accused the other of not respecting the truce.
"I don't have a problem with the ceasefire," Hemedti told Al Arabiya TV late on Saturday. The army "did not respect it. If they respect it, so will we."
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Residents of Khartoum and the adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri reported air strikes near the state broadcaster and battles in several areas including near the army headquarters.
One Bahri resident said there had been no water or electricity for a week and frequent air strikes. "We are waiting for the big fight. We are terrified of what's coming," she said, messaging later: "It's started."
TV feeds showed a huge cloud of black smoke rising from Khartoum airport.
Medecins Sans Frontieres appealed for safe passage. "We need ports of entry where we can bring specialist trauma staff and medical supplies," said Abdalla Hussein, Sudan operations manager for the medical charity.
The Sudanese doctors union said more than two-thirds of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service, with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in crossfire.
HUMANITARIAN RISK
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region that suffered a conflict which escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.
A U.N. update on Saturday said looters had taken at least 10 World Food Programme vehicles and six other food trucks after overrunning the agency's offices and warehouses in Nyala, south Darfur.
There has been no sign that either side can secure a quick victory or is ready to talk. The army has air power but the RSF is widely embedded in urban areas.
Burhan said on Saturday that "we all need to sit as Sudanese and find the right way out to return hope and life," his most conciliatory comments since fighting began.
Earlier in the clashes, he declared the RSF a rebel force, ordered it to be disbanded, and said a military solution was the only option. Hemedti said on Saturday he could not negotiate with Burhan.

Since Bashir's overthrow and after a 2021 coup, Burhan and Hemedti held the top positions on a ruling council that was meant to hand over to civilian rule and merge the RSF into the army.
The World Health Organization reported on Friday that 413 people had been killed and 3,551 injured since fighting broke out. The death toll includes at least five aid workers in a country reliant on food aid.

(Reuters) - Russia said on Saturday it was expelling more than 20 German diplomats in a tit-for-tat move. Germany did not immediately confirm any expulsions of its own, but said the arrival of a Russian government plane in Berlin was connected to the issue. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said Germany had decided to expel more than 20 Russians.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla's market share in its key California market tumbled in the first quarter of the year despite aggressive price cuts as rivals stepped up, data showed on Friday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc controlled 59.6% of the battery electric market in California from January to March, down from 72.7% for all of 2022 and the lowest since 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the California Energy Commission.
Rivals such as Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet and Kia Corp increased their market shares in California during the period, although they remain in the single digits each.
Tesla's sales in California accounted for 16% of the automaker's global deliveries last year, according to Reuters calculation. California is the biggest U.S. state for zero emission vehicles.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter and embrace of Republicans has sparked concerns about Tesla's brand, especially in liberal states like California.
Tesla has been slashing prices in the United States since January, cutting prices six times in the key market.

The price cuts, which were also carried out in China, Europe and other countries, hit Tesla's first-quarter margins, pushing its shares down nearly 10% on Thursday.
Musk this week signaled the EV maker would prioritize sales growth ahead of profit in a weak economy.

Investing.com - Looks like oil bears are defying OPEC+ again. And looks like OPEC+ will do the predictable thing again.
Crude prices had their first weekly decline in five as persistent U.S. rate hike and recession fears ended a rally in place since the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their 10 independent allies steered by Russia devised an output maneuver to rescue the market from 15-month lows.
The price move in the just-ended week wasn’t too large, with the drop being less than 6% — versus the four previous weeks when WTI rallied a total of 24% and Brent 18%.
What stood out about this decline was WTI’s return to below $80 a barrel by Friday’s close. Technical analysts say the U.S. crude benchmark still has a gap that needs to be filled between its March 31 settlement of $75.67 and the April 3 open of $80.10. That means WTI could drop to mid-$70 in the coming week, which could be another bearish week for oil before the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate decision on May 3.
If WTI gets to $75 or below, Brent, which trades at a $5 premium to the U.S. benchmark, risks dipping beneath the $80 mark too. This could again raise the ire of OPEC+. But is it all of OPEC+ that we need to be concerned about? Or is it just one name within the alliance?
Let's examine, beginning with Russia. The truth is Russia really doesn’t need to sell oil at $80 a barrel or more. Sure, the G7’s $60 per barrel cap on Urals crude is annoying to Vladimir Putin — both from a sovereign point and the negative impact it has in funding the Russian president's occupation of Ukraine.
Even so, with the G7, the powers within the Kremlin are realistic about what they’re up against: an entire global network of oil shippers, tanker insurers, issuers of letters of credit (i.e. banks) and other service providers who have no choice but to follow the dictates of the U.S. Treasury, or be sanctioned themselves.
As such, Moscow is content to supply as many barrels as necessary to willing customers (read: Indians and Chinese) at prices that work for both buyer/seller. And until a month ago at least, those prices were at or below the G7 cap.
The price Russia has paid on the West’s sanctions is, however, debatable.
According to Russian government data, revenue from oil and gas rose by 28%, or 2,500 billion rubles, in 2022. Converted, that comes to a neat $36.7 billion. Arguably, that spike was the result of the net increase in crude prices before the G7 price cap came into force in December last year. Global benchmark Brent went from just over $77 a barrel in December 2021 to a 14-year high above $139 in March 2022, right after the Ukraine invasion. After a selloff in the third quarter triggered by softer demand and growth worry, Brent finished last year at under $86.
Notwithstanding the G7 price cap, the West’s actions against Russia turned out to be manna from heaven for Indian oil importers and refiners, who imported record numbers of barrels from Russia at fire-sale prices, rebranded them as Indian oil and resold them at a premium.
The buyers included some of the same G7 nations, which knew only too well what was going on. It was what Washington desired anyway: The world should not be deprived of Russian oil, which is critical to a market already squeezed by OPEC cuts and other production outages. Also, the Biden administration’s aim was to throttle funding for Putin’s war in Ukraine and the price cap appears to have started doing that, the White House said.
So, price elasticity in oil is something that not just Russia but most countries within the OPEC+ alliance have learned to accept, even if they grumble about budget shortfalls from oil revenue.
Four of the Arab region’s most prolific oil producers, from second largest Iraq to the other three in respective order — the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iran — have all learned to adjust and tighten their belts when needed; except for one: Saudi Arabia.
At a time the world economy is contracting, Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman — often cryptically referred to by his initials MbS — is plunging $7 trillion into a redevelopment plan to diversify Saudi Arabia away from its oil economy. Called Vision 2030 and centered around a futuristic work-play-and-live hub called Neom, the seemingly noble plan mooted five years ago is today high in grandiosity and low on delivery. And MbS expects the rest of the world to pay for that through the Saudi hegemony of OPEC+.
The main reason OPEC+ went down the path of a second production cut announcement in four months — the first to reduce 2.0 million barrels per day was made only in November before another to take off another 1.7 million daily came in April— was to fulfill the Saudi need for $80 or more oil, which some say is critical to finance Neom, regardless what happens to the world economy.
To hear the Wall Street Journal put it, MbS “is in the midst of a plan to use his country’s gusher of oil revenue to transform its economy, rework its landscape and upend its conservative culture.” The report adds: “As prices hit $100 a barrel last year, the kingdom accelerated plans for its so-called giga-projects, which include a new city in the desert, as well as Red Sea resorts and a built-from-scratch tourism industry.”
Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman — MbS’ half brother — had promised last year to act quickly if he saw the oil market turning in the wrong direction. The back-to-back announcement of production cuts totaling 3.7 million barrels per day was apparently to fix that “wrong”, when one can argue the market was acting rightly given the concerns of demand in a recession.
“OPEC+ pre-emptive action may have been taken on accurate assumptions [that] the economy and demand … will not propel the price back above $100,” Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said on Friday.
According to OPEC+, seven of the 23 nations in the alliance — about a third of the group — will contribute to the new cuts, negotiated primarily between the Saudis and Russians to get ahead of a global slowdown. Russia, on its part, said it will extend till the end of the year the 500,000 barrels per day of cuts it pledged in March. The Saudis pledged an additional 500,000 barrels daily on top of what they claimed they were already cutting, with UAE promising 144,000, Kuwait 128,000, Oman 40,000 and Algeria 48,000. Kazakhstan — already in the news at that time over an exports blockade — pledged 78,000 barrels.
The Wall Street Journal also said Saudi Arabia wants higher crude prices to help “replenish Russia’s reserves”. That, of course, is utter fertilizer. Russian oil reserves don’t need Saudi bolstering. As the world’s biggest oil exporter, the Saudis have benefited even more from the Ukraine war than India. They, of course, did their bit for Russia too with their declaration that OPEC was apolitical and, therefore, could not condemn or would not act against Moscow over the invasion — an interesting position given that oil itself is the most politicized commodity.
The real problem with OPEC+’s production cuts — I call them maneuvers — is that like the Neom project, they are high on promise and low on stats. The original OPEC group, through most of its six decades, had a history of over-pledging and under-delivering on cuts. While the alliance achieved over-compliance on promised cuts in the aftermath of the 2020 coronavirus breakout, experts say that was more a result of battered demand that led to minimal production, rather than a will to cut barrels as pledged.
What OPEC+ is doing is using the power of the megaphone: Announce a cut, get a huge positive impact on prices, then produce what it really wants.
And if one thinks it through, it’s really quite simple to understand the OPEC+ mindset: No producer will turn away a buyer who wants more oil because the buyer will simply go to another source. With demand back at 2019 levels, almost every producer has been maxing output while publicly proclaiming adherence to production cuts.
By June though, global summer for oil is expected to accelerate, with or without production cuts. OPEC+ will simply raise output then, probably without any drama, while giving the appearance that it was still cutting the millions of barrels per day that it had pledged.
Should crude prices still totter at $70 levels or below at that time over recession worries, we know what the Saudis will do as the June 3 OPEC+ meeting approaches. The reality is MbS might not even wait till then — ordering his half-brother to take any arbitrary decision that can be dressed up later as a consensus — to push the market higher.
Oil: Market Settlements and Activity
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate for June delivery settled at $77.87 — up 50 cents, or 0.6%, on the day — as per CME data. For the week, June WTI was down 5.6% from the April 14 settlement of $82.52 for the front month contract.
On Investing.com, WTI for June delivery showed a final post-settlement trade of $77.95, as per capital.com data.
June Brent officially settled Friday’s trade at $81.66 — up 56 cents, or 0.7% — as per CME data. For the week, the global crude benchmark fell 5.4%.
London-traded Brent for June delivery showed a final trade of $81.75 per barrel on Investing.com in data published by capital.com.
Oil: Price Outlook
If oil bears attempt to force WTI to fill its April 3 gap of $75.67, Friday’s settlement of $77.87 for the June contract will first be dragged down to $77 and then be set up for a retest of the $75.80 support, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.
“After four weeks of strong positive action, WTI has fallen almost 6% for the first time in a week,” Dixit noted. “The weekly stochastics at 69/84 makes a negative overlap while RSI at 48 is positioned below neutrality of 50.”
“Major downside potential is seen at $73.80,” he added.
On the flip side, he said June WTI could move back towards $79.50, above which the 200-Day Simple Moving Average of $82.40 remains a strong resistance.”
Gold: Market Settlements and Activity
The most-active June gold futures contract on New York’s Comex settled Friday’s trade down $28.60, or 1.4%, at $1,990.50. The session bottom for June gold was $1,982.35. Since its run to a more than three year high of $2,048.60 on April 13, Comex’s most-active gold contract has lost almost 3%. For the current week, it was down 0.6%, after last week’s slide of 0.5%.
On Investing.com, gold for June delivery showed a final post-settlement trade of $1,994.10, as per capital.com data.
The spot price of gold, which reflects physical trades in bullion and is more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled down $21.17, or 1.1%, at $1,983.64. For the week, it was also down 1%.
The latest weekly decline in gold began after the Dollar Index and U.S. Treasury yields rebounded from the one-year lows hit last week. Gold is a direct contrarian trade to the dollar. Besides that, a higher dollar tends to weigh on overseas demand for commodities priced in the currency. Higher Treasury yields also sap the appeal of risk-heavy assets, while also limiting flows of foreign capital into the United States.
A relatively softer dollar in the past 24 hours, however, did not help gold.
Still, weighing on gold were concerns that the Federal Reserve will agree on another quarter point increase at its May 3rd rate decision which will bring U.S. interest rates to a peak of 5.25% — versus the pandemic-era rate of just 0.25%.
“Gold remains choppy as we near the end of the week,” said OANDA's analyst Erlam. “Uncertainty over the path of interest rates, which should become much clearer over the next month or two, is driving the indecision we're seeing in gold at the moment.”
While Erlam noted that higher Treasury yields had stalled the rally in the yellow metal, “traders are clearly in no mood to give up on the yellow metal.”
“As things stand, dips are being bought and it will be interesting to see if we see the same on this occasion as well,” he added. “Big support remains around $1,940-$1,960.”
Gold: Price Outlook
Dixit of SKCharting said an upward rebound in gold will require a strong breakout above the 5-Day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, of $1,996 and a horizontal resistance zone of $2,015 to retest the swing high of $2,048.
“Going forward into the week ahead, if the Dollar Index breaks and sustains above $109.95, we are likely to witness the dollar gaining further upside towards the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $103.10, followed by the 50-week EMA of $103.65,” said Dixit. “This may push gold lower towards the Fibonacci level of $1,955. In the event of any extended weakness, gold could even get to the 50-day EMA of $1,943.”
Natural Gas: Market Settlements and Activity
Natural gas bulls aren’t making much progress beyond the mid $2 level, but a second weekly win of 5% might assure those long on America’s favorite fuel for indoor temperature control that a price breakout could be imminent.
The most-active May gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled down 1.6 cents, or 0.7%, at $2.221 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units. For the week though, May gas was up 5.1%, mirroring last week’s run-up.
On Investing.com, gas for delivery in May shows a final post-settlement trade of $2.22, as per capital.com data.
The debate on when the bearish tide would irrevocably turn for ‘natty’ — as the all-season fuel for indoor heating and cooling is known — has raged since gas prices began their headlong fall from 14-year highs of $10 in August to crash to 2-1/2 year lows beneath $2.
At brief intervals over the past two months, the market had appeared to be on the cusp of a serious rebound — like in late February when it got above $3 after breaking below $2 earlier that month for the first time since September 2020.
This week, again, such a phenomenon appeared when the front-month May gas contract rallied to almost $2.40 — a level it had not reached since late March — exciting traders and analysts over the prospect of $3 pricing and beyond.
Friday’s slide in gas prices came as investor focus returned to the abysmal state of U.S. gas inventories held in storage, after one of the warmest winters on record.
Gas storage for the week ended April 14 rose by 75 billion cubic feet, or bcf, after all the burning done for power generation as well as for heating as some unexpected chill for this time of the year surfaced, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reported.
That 75-bcf injection bumped up total gas inventories to 1.930 trillion cubic feet, or tcf, EIA records showed. At current levels, the gas storage stands at 34% above the year-ago level of 1.442 tcf and nearly 21% higher than the five-year average of 1.601 tcf.
In the short term, Henry Hub prices could continue to recover in the higher $2 trajectory, said analysts at Houston-based energy markets advisory Gelber & Associates.
“Weather forecasts from major weather models still show a cold front coming through in the coming days, leading to colder than average end of April and beginning of May,” Gelber’s analysts said in a note issued on Friday to the firm’s natural gas clients. “This cold front is expected to increase weather-driven demand to high levels.”
But the mid-term outlook remained cloudy, the note said.
“Overall, the market still has way too much supply for these small weather runs to significantly affect the supply/demand balance,” Gelber’s analysts added.
Natural gas: Price Outlook
In what seems to be a flattening bottom which is still too early to be confirmed, natural gas futures closed above the 5-week EMA for a second time, noted Dixit of SKCharting.
“If breakout from the descending channel withstands bearish pressure, clearing through the 50-day EMA dynamically positioned at $2.52 will be an immediate challenge,” he said. “This may extend the upward move towards swing high to $3.03.”
A break below the daily Middle Bollinger Band of $2.15 may begin some decline towards the small gap left at $2.11 and extend that towards $2.04, Dixit added.

(Reuters) - British chipmaker Arm Ltd is building its own semiconductor to showcase the capabilities of its products, as it seeks to attract new customers and fuel growth following its Initial Public Offering (IPO) later this year, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
Arm will team up with manufacturing partners to develop the new semiconductor, FT said, citing people briefed on the move, adding that the company has built a new "solutions engineering" team that will lead the development of these prototype chips for mobile devices, laptops and other electronics.
The SoftBank Group Corp-backed company's newest chip, on which it started work in the past six months, is "more advanced" than ever before, FT said, citing industry executives.
The chip designer has no plans to sell or license the product and is only working on a prototype, FT said.
Arm is a major supplier of intellectual property to many chip companies, especially in mobile phones and has partnerships with major chip contract manufacturers.

Earlier this month, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) said it will work with Arm to ensure that mobile phone chips and other products that use Arm's technology can be made in Intel's factories.
Arm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

(Reuters) - Russia said on Saturday it was expelling more than 20 German diplomats in a tit-for-tat move. Germany did not immediately confirm any expulsions of its own, but said the arrival of a Russian government plane in Berlin was connected to the issue. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said Germany had decided to expel more than 20 Russians.

(Reuters) -Climate change campaigners gathered in New York's Times Square on Earth Day to urge action on global warming and cuts in plastics use while volunteers worldwide planted trees and cleared trash to mark the 54th annual celebration of the environment.
Earth Day this year, officially on Saturday, follows weeks of extreme weather with temperatures soaring to record highs in Thailand and a punishing heatwave in India, where at least 13 people died of heatstroke at a ceremony last weekend.
Average global temperatures could hit all-time highs in 2023 or 2024, climate scientists have warned.
Pope Francis, who has championed green causes since his election in 2013, urged people to look after the environment.
"The Book of Genesis tells us that the Lord entrusted human beings with the responsibility of being stewards of creation (Gen 2:15). Care for the Earth, then, is a moral obligation for all men and women as children of God #EarthDay," he tweeted on Saturday.
"Climate impacts are here," Areeba Hamid, co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said on Friday as climate change activists walked down the street outside parliament in London, some dressed in green costumes and green paint.
Hamid said when she now visits her hometown of Delhi, it feels like "putting your head in the oven" and that London's 2022 heatwave was like "a dystopian film".
"We can't afford that anymore."
Activists led by the Extinction Rebellion group have gathered in London to kick off a four-day action, billed "The Big One", to coincide with Earth Day.
About 30,000 people have signed up for family-friendly rallies and marches, marking a change in strategy for a group known for its disruptive tactics, including blocking roads, throwing paint and smashing windows.
CLEAN-UPS AND RITUALS
Globally, there was a flurry of activity in the run-up to Earth Day, with events being planned in Rome and Boston and major clean-up campaigns at Lake Dal in India's Srinagar and Florida's hurricane-hit Cape Coral.
In Peru, shamans on Friday made an offering to the "Pachamama", or Mother Earth. Holding yellow flowers and rattles, the shamans walked around a papier-mache globe as they performed a cleansing ritual.
The ancestral rituals - whose origins lie in the Indigenous cultures of Peru - are done to thank the Earth and build awareness of the planet, said Walter Alarcon, the president of the Healing Shamans of Peru International Organization.
New York City banned cars on streets in at least 31 locations for five hours on Saturday and held concerts in Times Square. In Washington, the Climate Justice Alliance marched, calling for an end of the fossil fuel era, accompanied by a brass jazz band.
Earlier in the week, U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to increase funding to help developing countries fight climate change and curb deforestation in Brazil's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest during a meeting with top world leaders. Domestically, he ordered a number of new measures that would protect communities overburdened by pollution, including creating a new White House office of environmental justice and launching a national strategy to prevent plastic pollution.
Governments have fallen far short of pledges in the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit heating of the climate by shifting off fossil fuels, amid crises including COVID-19, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, food shortages and strained ties between China and the U.S., the top two greenhouse gas emitters.

A report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says the planet is on track to warm beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times - a key threshold for even more damaging impacts - between 2030 and 2035.
"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all," the IPCC has said. "The choices and actions implemented in this decade will have impacts now and for thousands of years."

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -The United States said it had evacuated its embassy staff from Sudan, but planned evacuations by some other countries appeared to face problems on Sunday amid battles between rival military factions that have triggered a humanitarian crisis.
Sudan's warring army and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group accused each other of attacking a convoy of French nationals, both saying one French person was wounded. France's Foreign Ministry, which had earlier said it was evacuating diplomatic staff and citizens, did not comment on the reports.
The army also accused the RSF of attacking and looting a Qatari convoy heading to Port Sudan. Doha released no immediate statement on any incident.
Egypt said a member of its mission in Sudan had been wounded by a gunshot, without giving details.
President Joe Biden said the U.S. was temporarily suspending operations at its embassy in Khartoum but remained committed to the Sudanese people, reiterating calls for a ceasefire that have so far gone largely unheeded.
"The belligerent parties must implement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and respect the will of the people of Sudan," Biden said in a statement.
Live TV feeds showed thick smoke still hanging over the capital, Khartoum, and its sister cities of Bahri and Ombdurman, as gunfire continued to ring out in some areas, a Reuters reporter said.
The fighting erupted in Khartoum and other parts of the country on April 15, four years after long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir was toppled during a popular uprising, and has killed more than 400 people.
It pits Sudan's army against the RSF, who jointly staged a coup in 2021 but fell out during negotiations over a plan to form a civilian government and integrate the RSF into the armed forces.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily, including a three-day truce for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which began on Friday.
Intense fighting has continued around the army's headquarters in central Khartoum and the airport, which has been closed by the clashes, and over the past two days in Bahri, where the army has used troops on the ground as well as air strikes to try to push back the RSF.
The RSF said on Sunday that its forces were targeted by air strikes in Bahri's Kafouri district and that dozens were "killed and injured".
"We strongly condemn this treacherous behaviour, which is inconsistent with the declared commitment to the 72-hour truce," the RSF said in a statement.
CHINOOKS
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare has dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers.
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Diplomats and foreign nationals have also struggled to find a way out.
U.S. officials said special forces using aircraft including MH-47 Chinook helicopters swept into Sudan's battle-stricken capital on Saturday from a U.S. base in Djibouti, spending just one hour on the ground to bring out fewer than 100 people.
"We did not take any small-arms fire on the way in and were able to get in and out without issue," said Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of operations at the military's Joint Staff.
Chris Maier, an assistant secretary of defense, said the U.S. military might use drone or satellite imagery to detect threats to Americans travelling on overland routes out of Sudan, or position naval assets at the Port of Sudan to aid Americans arriving there.
Under Secretary of State for Management John Bass said some Americans and other nationals had successfully travelled by land from Khartoum to Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which he said appeared to be a challenging journey given the lack of fuel, food and predictably available water.
Saudi Arabia has already evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.

Egypt, which has more than 10,000 citizens in Sudan, urged its nationals outside Khartoum to head to its consulate in Port Sudan, and to a consular office in Wadi Halfa on the border with Egypt, in preparation for their evacuation. It encouraged those in Khartoum to shelter in place and wait for the situation to improve.
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region bordering Chad that suffered a conflict that escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.

2023-04-23 19:02:48,494 - INFO - LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, the wife of Britain's Prince Harry, criticised the British media on Saturday over reports that letters exchanged with King Charles played a part behind her decision not to attend his coronation, her latest confrontation with the press.
The Daily Telegraph reported Meghan had written to the now king to express her concerns about unconscious bias in the royal family. It said the letter was sent following her 2021 comments in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that the family had raised concerns about how dark her son's skin would be.
It reported the Duchess of Sussex did not feel she had received a satisfactory response to her concerns.
"The Duchess of Sussex is going about her life in the present, not thinking about correspondence from two years ago related to conversations from four years ago," a spokesperson for Meghan said.
"Any suggestion otherwise is false and frankly ridiculous. We encourage tabloid media and various royal correspondents to stop the exhausting circus that they alone are creating."

Prince Harry will attend the coronation next month without Meghan, who will remain in California with the couple's two young children. Their eldest, Archie, turns four on the same day.
Harry and Meghan stepped down from royal duties in March 2020, saying they wanted to make new lives in the United States away from media harassment.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla's market share in its key California market tumbled in the first quarter of the year despite aggressive price cuts as rivals stepped up, data showed on Friday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc controlled 59.6% of the battery electric market in California from January to March, down from 72.7% for all of 2022 and the lowest since 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the California Energy Commission.
Rivals such as Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet and Kia Corp increased their market shares in California during the period, although they remain in the single digits each.
Tesla's sales in California accounted for 16% of the automaker's global deliveries last year, according to Reuters calculation. California is the biggest U.S. state for zero emission vehicles.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter and embrace of Republicans has sparked concerns about Tesla's brand, especially in liberal states like California.
Tesla has been slashing prices in the United States since January, cutting prices six times in the key market.

The price cuts, which were also carried out in China, Europe and other countries, hit Tesla's first-quarter margins, pushing its shares down nearly 10% on Thursday.
Musk this week signaled the EV maker would prioritize sales growth ahead of profit in a weak economy.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The U.S. military evacuated American government personnel from Khartoum, President Joe Biden said on Saturday, adding that Washington is suspending operations at its embassy there as fighting between Sudan's rival commanders continued.
"This tragic violence in Sudan has already cost the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians," Biden said in a statement. "It's unconscionable and it must stop."
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that "all U.S. personnel and their dependents" have been safely evacuated and that the U.S. will continue to assist Americans in Sudan in planning for their own safety.
All U.S. government personnel and a small number of diplomatic personnel from other countries were evacuated in the operation, which removed fewer than 100 people, U.S. officials said.
Just over 100 U.S. special operations forces were involved in the evacuation, entering and exiting Sudan without being fired upon by the warring factions on the ground, U.S. military officials said.
Other foreign nationals began evacuating from a Red Sea port in Sudan on Saturday. Japan's TBS news reported that the United Nations staff members including Japanese nationals and their families would be evacuated from Sudan as early as Sunday.
The bloody onslaught of urban warfare has trapped large numbers in the Sudanese capital, disabling the airport and rendering some roads impassable.
The U.N. and foreign states have urged rival military leaders to honour declared ceasefires that have mostly been ignored, and to open safe passage for fleeing civilians and the supply of badly needed aid.
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers, four years after the overthrow of long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a popular uprising.
With the airport closed and skies unsafe, thousands of foreigners - including embassy staff, aid workers and students in Khartoum and elsewhere in Africa's third largest country - have also been unable to get out.
Saudi Arabia has evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.
'HOURS OF TERROR'
Western countries are expected to send planes for their citizens from Djibouti, though the Sudanese army has said airports in Khartoum and Darfur's biggest city, Nyala, are problematic and it was not clear when that might be possible.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the rival RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily since hostilities broke out on April 15.
Saturday's fighting breached what was meant to be a three-day truce from Friday to allow citizens to reach safety and visit family during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Each side accused the other of not respecting the truce.
"I don't have a problem with the ceasefire," Hemedti told Al Arabiya TV late on Saturday. The army "did not respect it. If they respect it, so will we."
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Residents of Khartoum and the adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri reported air strikes near the state broadcaster and battles in several areas including near the army headquarters.
One Bahri resident said there had been no water or electricity for a week and frequent air strikes. "We are waiting for the big fight. We are terrified of what's coming," she said, messaging later: "It's started."
TV feeds showed a huge cloud of black smoke rising from Khartoum airport.
Medecins Sans Frontieres appealed for safe passage. "We need ports of entry where we can bring specialist trauma staff and medical supplies," said Abdalla Hussein, Sudan operations manager for the medical charity.
The Sudanese doctors union said more than two-thirds of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service, with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in crossfire.
HUMANITARIAN RISK
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region that suffered a conflict which escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.
A U.N. update on Saturday said looters had taken at least 10 World Food Programme vehicles and six other food trucks after overrunning the agency's offices and warehouses in Nyala, south Darfur.
There has been no sign that either side can secure a quick victory or is ready to talk. The army has air power but the RSF is widely embedded in urban areas.
Burhan said on Saturday that "we all need to sit as Sudanese and find the right way out to return hope and life," his most conciliatory comments since fighting began.
Earlier in the clashes, he declared the RSF a rebel force, ordered it to be disbanded, and said a military solution was the only option. Hemedti said on Saturday he could not negotiate with Burhan.

Since Bashir's overthrow and after a 2021 coup, Burhan and Hemedti held the top positions on a ruling council that was meant to hand over to civilian rule and merge the RSF into the army.
The World Health Organization reported on Friday that 413 people had been killed and 3,551 injured since fighting broke out. The death toll includes at least five aid workers in a country reliant on food aid.

By Barani Krishnan
Investing.com - Looks like oil bears are defying OPEC+ again. And looks like OPEC+ will do the predictable thing again.
Crude prices had their first weekly decline in five as persistent U.S. rate hike and recession fears ended a rally in place since the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their 10 independent allies steered by Russia devised an output maneuver to rescue the market from 15-month lows.
The price move in the just-ended week wasn’t too large, with the drop being less than 6% — versus the four previous weeks when WTI rallied a total of 24% and Brent 18%.
What stood out about this decline was WTI’s return to below $80 a barrel by Friday’s close. Technical analysts say the U.S. crude benchmark still has a gap that needs to be filled between its March 31 settlement of $75.67 and the April 3 open of $80.10. That means WTI could drop to mid-$70 in the coming week, which could be another bearish week for oil before the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate decision on May 3.
If WTI gets to $75 or below, Brent, which trades at a $5 premium to the U.S. benchmark, risks dipping beneath the $80 mark too. This could again raise the ire of OPEC+. But is it all of OPEC+ that we need to be concerned about? Or is it just one name within the alliance?
Let's examine, beginning with Russia. The truth is Russia really doesn’t need to sell oil at $80 a barrel or more. Sure, the G7’s $60 per barrel cap on Urals crude is annoying to Vladimir Putin — both from a sovereign point and the negative impact it has in funding the Russian president's occupation of Ukraine.
Even so, with the G7, the powers within the Kremlin are realistic about what they’re up against: an entire global network of oil shippers, tanker insurers, issuers of letters of credit (i.e. banks) and other service providers who have no choice but to follow the dictates of the U.S. Treasury, or be sanctioned themselves.
As such, Moscow is content to supply as many barrels as necessary to willing customers (read: Indians and Chinese) at prices that work for both buyer/seller. And until a month ago at least, those prices were at or below the G7 cap.
The price Russia has paid on the West’s sanctions is, however, debatable.
According to Russian government data, revenue from oil and gas rose by 28%, or 2,500 billion rubles, in 2022. Converted, that comes to a neat $36.7 billion. Arguably, that spike was the result of the net increase in crude prices before the G7 price cap came into force in December last year. Global benchmark Brent went from just over $77 a barrel in December 2021 to a 14-year high above $139 in March 2022, right after the Ukraine invasion. After a selloff in the third quarter triggered by softer demand and growth worry, Brent finished last year at under $86.
Notwithstanding the G7 price cap, the West’s actions against Russia turned out to be manna from heaven for Indian oil importers and refiners, who imported record numbers of barrels from Russia at fire-sale prices, rebranded them as Indian oil and resold them at a premium.
The buyers included some of the same G7 nations, which knew only too well what was going on. It was what Washington desired anyway: The world should not be deprived of Russian oil, which is critical to a market already squeezed by OPEC cuts and other production outages. Also, the Biden administration’s aim was to throttle funding for Putin’s war in Ukraine and the price cap appears to have started doing that, the White House said.
So, price elasticity in oil is something that not just Russia but most countries within the OPEC+ alliance have learned to accept, even if they grumble about budget shortfalls from oil revenue.
Four of the Arab region’s most prolific oil producers, from second largest Iraq to the other three in respective order — the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iran — have all learned to adjust and tighten their belts when needed; except for one: Saudi Arabia.
At a time the world economy is contracting, Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman — often cryptically referred to by his initials MbS — is plunging $7 trillion into a redevelopment plan to diversify Saudi Arabia away from its oil economy. Called Vision 2030 and centered around a futuristic work-play-and-live hub called Neom, the seemingly noble plan mooted five years ago is today high in grandiosity and low on delivery. And MbS expects the rest of the world to pay for that through the Saudi hegemony of OPEC+.
The main reason OPEC+ went down the path of a second production cut announcement in four months — the first to reduce 2.0 million barrels per day was made only in November before another to take off another 1.7 million daily came in April— was to fulfill the Saudi need for $80 or more oil, which some say is critical to finance Neom, regardless what happens to the world economy.
To hear the Wall Street Journal put it, MbS “is in the midst of a plan to use his country’s gusher of oil revenue to transform its economy, rework its landscape and upend its conservative culture.” The report adds: “As prices hit $100 a barrel last year, the kingdom accelerated plans for its so-called giga-projects, which include a new city in the desert, as well as Red Sea resorts and a built-from-scratch tourism industry.”
Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman — MbS’ half brother — had promised last year to act quickly if he saw the oil market turning in the wrong direction. The back-to-back announcement of production cuts totaling 3.7 million barrels per day was apparently to fix that “wrong”, when one can argue the market was acting rightly given the concerns of demand in a recession.
“OPEC+ pre-emptive action may have been taken on accurate assumptions [that] the economy and demand … will not propel the price back above $100,” Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said on Friday.
According to OPEC+, seven of the 23 nations in the alliance — about a third of the group — will contribute to the new cuts, negotiated primarily between the Saudis and Russians to get ahead of a global slowdown. Russia, on its part, said it will extend till the end of the year the 500,000 barrels per day of cuts it pledged in March. The Saudis pledged an additional 500,000 barrels daily on top of what they claimed they were already cutting, with UAE promising 144,000, Kuwait 128,000, Oman 40,000 and Algeria 48,000. Kazakhstan — already in the news at that time over an exports blockade — pledged 78,000 barrels.
The Wall Street Journal also said Saudi Arabia wants higher crude prices to help “replenish Russia’s reserves”. That, of course, is utter fertilizer. Russian oil reserves don’t need Saudi bolstering. As the world’s biggest oil exporter, the Saudis have benefited even more from the Ukraine war than India. They, of course, did their bit for Russia too with their declaration that OPEC was apolitical and, therefore, could not condemn or would not act against Moscow over the invasion — an interesting position given that oil itself is the most politicized commodity.
The real problem with OPEC+’s production cuts — I call them maneuvers — is that like the Neom project, they are high on promise and low on stats. The original OPEC group, through most of its six decades, had a history of over-pledging and under-delivering on cuts. While the alliance achieved over-compliance on promised cuts in the aftermath of the 2020 coronavirus breakout, experts say that was more a result of battered demand that led to minimal production, rather than a will to cut barrels as pledged.
What OPEC+ is doing is using the power of the megaphone: Announce a cut, get a huge positive impact on prices, then produce what it really wants.
And if one thinks it through, it’s really quite simple to understand the OPEC+ mindset: No producer will turn away a buyer who wants more oil because the buyer will simply go to another source. With demand back at 2019 levels, almost every producer has been maxing output while publicly proclaiming adherence to production cuts.
By June though, global summer for oil is expected to accelerate, with or without production cuts. OPEC+ will simply raise output then, probably without any drama, while giving the appearance that it was still cutting the millions of barrels per day that it had pledged.
Should crude prices still totter at $70 levels or below at that time over recession worries, we know what the Saudis will do as the June 3 OPEC+ meeting approaches. The reality is MbS might not even wait till then — ordering his half-brother to take any arbitrary decision that can be dressed up later as a consensus — to push the market higher.
Oil: Market Settlements and Activity
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate for June delivery settled at $77.87 — up 50 cents, or 0.6%, on the day — as per CME data. For the week, June WTI was down 5.6% from the April 14 settlement of $82.52 for the front month contract.
On Investing.com, WTI for June delivery showed a final post-settlement trade of $77.95, as per capital.com data.
June Brent officially settled Friday’s trade at $81.66 — up 56 cents, or 0.7% — as per CME data. For the week, the global crude benchmark fell 5.4%.
London-traded Brent for June delivery showed a final trade of $81.75 per barrel on Investing.com in data published by capital.com.
Oil: Price Outlook
If oil bears attempt to force WTI to fill its April 3 gap of $75.67, Friday’s settlement of $77.87 for the June contract will first be dragged down to $77 and then be set up for a retest of the $75.80 support, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.
“After four weeks of strong positive action, WTI has fallen almost 6% for the first time in a week,” Dixit noted. “The weekly stochastics at 69/84 makes a negative overlap while RSI at 48 is positioned below neutrality of 50.”
“Major downside potential is seen at $73.80,” he added.
On the flip side, he said June WTI could move back towards $79.50, above which the 200-Day Simple Moving Average of $82.40 remains a strong resistance.”
Gold: Market Settlements and Activity
The most-active June gold futures contract on New York’s Comex settled Friday’s trade down $28.60, or 1.4%, at $1,990.50. The session bottom for June gold was $1,982.35. Since its run to a more than three year high of $2,048.60 on April 13, Comex’s most-active gold contract has lost almost 3%. For the current week, it was down 0.6%, after last week’s slide of 0.5%.
On Investing.com, gold for June delivery showed a final post-settlement trade of $1,994.10, as per capital.com data.
The spot price of gold, which reflects physical trades in bullion and is more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled down $21.17, or 1.1%, at $1,983.64. For the week, it was also down 1%.
The latest weekly decline in gold began after the Dollar Index and U.S. Treasury yields rebounded from the one-year lows hit last week. Gold is a direct contrarian trade to the dollar. Besides that, a higher dollar tends to weigh on overseas demand for commodities priced in the currency. Higher Treasury yields also sap the appeal of risk-heavy assets, while also limiting flows of foreign capital into the United States.
A relatively softer dollar in the past 24 hours, however, did not help gold.
Still, weighing on gold were concerns that the Federal Reserve will agree on another quarter point increase at its May 3rd rate decision which will bring U.S. interest rates to a peak of 5.25% — versus the pandemic-era rate of just 0.25%.
“Gold remains choppy as we near the end of the week,” said OANDA's analyst Erlam. “Uncertainty over the path of interest rates, which should become much clearer over the next month or two, is driving the indecision we're seeing in gold at the moment.”
While Erlam noted that higher Treasury yields had stalled the rally in the yellow metal, “traders are clearly in no mood to give up on the yellow metal.”
“As things stand, dips are being bought and it will be interesting to see if we see the same on this occasion as well,” he added. “Big support remains around $1,940-$1,960.”
Gold: Price Outlook
Dixit of SKCharting said an upward rebound in gold will require a strong breakout above the 5-Day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, of $1,996 and a horizontal resistance zone of $2,015 to retest the swing high of $2,048.
“Going forward into the week ahead, if the Dollar Index breaks and sustains above $109.95, we are likely to witness the dollar gaining further upside towards the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $103.10, followed by the 50-week EMA of $103.65,” said Dixit. “This may push gold lower towards the Fibonacci level of $1,955. In the event of any extended weakness, gold could even get to the 50-day EMA of $1,943.”
Natural Gas: Market Settlements and Activity
Natural gas bulls aren’t making much progress beyond the mid $2 level, but a second weekly win of 5% might assure those long on America’s favorite fuel for indoor temperature control that a price breakout could be imminent.
The most-active May gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled down 1.6 cents, or 0.7%, at $2.221 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units. For the week though, May gas was up 5.1%, mirroring last week’s run-up.
On Investing.com, gas for delivery in May shows a final post-settlement trade of $2.22, as per capital.com data.
The debate on when the bearish tide would irrevocably turn for ‘natty’ — as the all-season fuel for indoor heating and cooling is known — has raged since gas prices began their headlong fall from 14-year highs of $10 in August to crash to 2-1/2 year lows beneath $2.
At brief intervals over the past two months, the market had appeared to be on the cusp of a serious rebound — like in late February when it got above $3 after breaking below $2 earlier that month for the first time since September 2020.
This week, again, such a phenomenon appeared when the front-month May gas contract rallied to almost $2.40 — a level it had not reached since late March — exciting traders and analysts over the prospect of $3 pricing and beyond.
Friday’s slide in gas prices came as investor focus returned to the abysmal state of U.S. gas inventories held in storage, after one of the warmest winters on record.
Gas storage for the week ended April 14 rose by 75 billion cubic feet, or bcf, after all the burning done for power generation as well as for heating as some unexpected chill for this time of the year surfaced, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reported.
That 75-bcf injection bumped up total gas inventories to 1.930 trillion cubic feet, or tcf, EIA records showed. At current levels, the gas storage stands at 34% above the year-ago level of 1.442 tcf and nearly 21% higher than the five-year average of 1.601 tcf.
In the short term, Henry Hub prices could continue to recover in the higher $2 trajectory, said analysts at Houston-based energy markets advisory Gelber & Associates.
“Weather forecasts from major weather models still show a cold front coming through in the coming days, leading to colder than average end of April and beginning of May,” Gelber’s analysts said in a note issued on Friday to the firm’s natural gas clients. “This cold front is expected to increase weather-driven demand to high levels.”
But the mid-term outlook remained cloudy, the note said.
“Overall, the market still has way too much supply for these small weather runs to significantly affect the supply/demand balance,” Gelber’s analysts added.
Natural gas: Price Outlook
In what seems to be a flattening bottom which is still too early to be confirmed, natural gas futures closed above the 5-week EMA for a second time, noted Dixit of SKCharting.
“If breakout from the descending channel withstands bearish pressure, clearing through the 50-day EMA dynamically positioned at $2.52 will be an immediate challenge,” he said. “This may extend the upward move towards swing high to $3.03.”
A break below the daily Middle Bollinger Band of $2.15 may begin some decline towards the small gap left at $2.11 and extend that towards $2.04, Dixit added.

(Reuters) - British chipmaker Arm Ltd is building its own semiconductor to showcase the capabilities of its products, as it seeks to attract new customers and fuel growth following its Initial Public Offering (IPO) later this year, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
Arm will team up with manufacturing partners to develop the new semiconductor, FT said, citing people briefed on the move, adding that the company has built a new "solutions engineering" team that will lead the development of these prototype chips for mobile devices, laptops and other electronics.
The SoftBank Group Corp-backed company's newest chip, on which it started work in the past six months, is "more advanced" than ever before, FT said, citing industry executives.
The chip designer has no plans to sell or license the product and is only working on a prototype, FT said.
Arm is a major supplier of intellectual property to many chip companies, especially in mobile phones and has partnerships with major chip contract manufacturers.

Earlier this month, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) said it will work with Arm to ensure that mobile phone chips and other products that use Arm's technology can be made in Intel's factories.
Arm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

(Reuters) -Climate change campaigners gathered in New York's Times Square on Earth Day to urge action on global warming and cuts in plastics use while volunteers worldwide planted trees and cleared trash to mark the 54th annual celebration of the environment.
Earth Day this year, officially on Saturday, follows weeks of extreme weather with temperatures soaring to record highs in Thailand and a punishing heatwave in India, where at least 13 people died of heatstroke at a ceremony last weekend.
Average global temperatures could hit all-time highs in 2023 or 2024, climate scientists have warned.
Pope Francis, who has championed green causes since his election in 2013, urged people to look after the environment.
"The Book of Genesis tells us that the Lord entrusted human beings with the responsibility of being stewards of creation (Gen 2:15). Care for the Earth, then, is a moral obligation for all men and women as children of God #EarthDay," he tweeted on Saturday.
"Climate impacts are here," Areeba Hamid, co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said on Friday as climate change activists walked down the street outside parliament in London, some dressed in green costumes and green paint.
Hamid said when she now visits her hometown of Delhi, it feels like "putting your head in the oven" and that London's 2022 heatwave was like "a dystopian film".
"We can't afford that anymore."
Activists led by the Extinction Rebellion group have gathered in London to kick off a four-day action, billed "The Big One", to coincide with Earth Day.
About 30,000 people have signed up for family-friendly rallies and marches, marking a change in strategy for a group known for its disruptive tactics, including blocking roads, throwing paint and smashing windows.
CLEAN-UPS AND RITUALS
Globally, there was a flurry of activity in the run-up to Earth Day, with events being planned in Rome and Boston and major clean-up campaigns at Lake Dal in India's Srinagar and Florida's hurricane-hit Cape Coral.
In Peru, shamans on Friday made an offering to the "Pachamama", or Mother Earth. Holding yellow flowers and rattles, the shamans walked around a papier-mache globe as they performed a cleansing ritual.
The ancestral rituals - whose origins lie in the Indigenous cultures of Peru - are done to thank the Earth and build awareness of the planet, said Walter Alarcon, the president of the Healing Shamans of Peru International Organization.
New York City banned cars on streets in at least 31 locations for five hours on Saturday and held concerts in Times Square. In Washington, the Climate Justice Alliance marched, calling for an end of the fossil fuel era, accompanied by a brass jazz band.
Earlier in the week, U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to increase funding to help developing countries fight climate change and curb deforestation in Brazil's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest during a meeting with top world leaders. Domestically, he ordered a number of new measures that would protect communities overburdened by pollution, including creating a new White House office of environmental justice and launching a national strategy to prevent plastic pollution.
Governments have fallen far short of pledges in the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit heating of the climate by shifting off fossil fuels, amid crises including COVID-19, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, food shortages and strained ties between China and the U.S., the top two greenhouse gas emitters.

A report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says the planet is on track to warm beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times - a key threshold for even more damaging impacts - between 2030 and 2035.
"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all," the IPCC has said. "The choices and actions implemented in this decade will have impacts now and for thousands of years."

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -The United States said it had evacuated its embassy staff from Sudan, but planned evacuations by some other countries appeared to face problems on Sunday amid battles between rival military factions that have triggered a humanitarian crisis.
Sudan's warring army and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group accused each other of attacking a convoy of French nationals, both saying one French person was wounded. France's Foreign Ministry, which had earlier said it was evacuating diplomatic staff and citizens, did not comment on the reports.
The army also accused the RSF of attacking and looting a Qatari convoy heading to Port Sudan. Doha released no immediate statement on any incident.
Egypt said a member of its mission in Sudan had been wounded by a gunshot, without giving details.
President Joe Biden said the U.S. was temporarily suspending operations at its embassy in Khartoum but remained committed to the Sudanese people, reiterating calls for a ceasefire that have so far gone largely unheeded.
"The belligerent parties must implement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and respect the will of the people of Sudan," Biden said in a statement.
Live TV feeds showed thick smoke still hanging over the capital, Khartoum, and its sister cities of Bahri and Ombdurman, as gunfire continued to ring out in some areas, a Reuters reporter said.
The fighting erupted in Khartoum and other parts of the country on April 15, four years after long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir was toppled during a popular uprising, and has killed more than 400 people.
It pits Sudan's army against the RSF, who jointly staged a coup in 2021 but fell out during negotiations over a plan to form a civilian government and integrate the RSF into the armed forces.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily, including a three-day truce for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which began on Friday.
Intense fighting has continued around the army's headquarters in central Khartoum and the airport, which has been closed by the clashes, and over the past two days in Bahri, where the army has used troops on the ground as well as air strikes to try to push back the RSF.
The RSF said on Sunday that its forces were targeted by air strikes in Bahri's Kafouri district and that dozens were "killed and injured".
"We strongly condemn this treacherous behaviour, which is inconsistent with the declared commitment to the 72-hour truce," the RSF said in a statement.
CHINOOKS
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare has dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers.
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Diplomats and foreign nationals have also struggled to find a way out.
U.S. officials said special forces using aircraft including MH-47 Chinook helicopters swept into Sudan's battle-stricken capital on Saturday from a U.S. base in Djibouti, spending just one hour on the ground to bring out fewer than 100 people.
"We did not take any small-arms fire on the way in and were able to get in and out without issue," said Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of operations at the military's Joint Staff.
Chris Maier, an assistant secretary of defense, said the U.S. military might use drone or satellite imagery to detect threats to Americans travelling on overland routes out of Sudan, or position naval assets at the Port of Sudan to aid Americans arriving there.
Under Secretary of State for Management John Bass said some Americans and other nationals had successfully travelled by land from Khartoum to Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which he said appeared to be a challenging journey given the lack of fuel, food and predictably available water.
Saudi Arabia has already evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.

Egypt, which has more than 10,000 citizens in Sudan, urged its nationals outside Khartoum to head to its consulate in Port Sudan, and to a consular office in Wadi Halfa on the border with Egypt, in preparation for their evacuation. It encouraged those in Khartoum to shelter in place and wait for the situation to improve.
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region bordering Chad that suffered a conflict that escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.

2023-04-23 19:08:37,285 - INFO - LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, the wife of Britain's Prince Harry, criticised the British media on Saturday over reports that letters exchanged with King Charles played a part behind her decision not to attend his coronation, her latest confrontation with the press.
The Daily Telegraph reported Meghan had written to the now king to express her concerns about unconscious bias in the royal family. It said the letter was sent following her 2021 comments in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that the family had raised concerns about how dark her son's skin would be.
It reported the Duchess of Sussex did not feel she had received a satisfactory response to her concerns.
"The Duchess of Sussex is going about her life in the present, not thinking about correspondence from two years ago related to conversations from four years ago," a spokesperson for Meghan said.
"Any suggestion otherwise is false and frankly ridiculous. We encourage tabloid media and various royal correspondents to stop the exhausting circus that they alone are creating."

Prince Harry will attend the coronation next month without Meghan, who will remain in California with the couple's two young children. Their eldest, Archie, turns four on the same day.
Harry and Meghan stepped down from royal duties in March 2020, saying they wanted to make new lives in the United States away from media harassment.

(Reuters) - Russia said on Saturday it was expelling more than 20 German diplomats in a tit-for-tat move. Germany did not immediately confirm any expulsions of its own, but said the arrival of a Russian government plane in Berlin was connected to the issue. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said Germany had decided to expel more than 20 Russians.
FIGHTING
* At least five Russian missiles hit the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and surrounding districts late on Saturday night, causing some damage to civilian buildings, local officials said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla's market share in its key California market tumbled in the first quarter of the year despite aggressive price cuts as rivals stepped up, data showed on Friday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc controlled 59.6% of the battery electric market in California from January to March, down from 72.7% for all of 2022 and the lowest since 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the California Energy Commission.
Rivals such as Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet and Kia Corp increased their market shares in California during the period, although they remain in the single digits each.
Tesla's sales in California accounted for 16% of the automaker's global deliveries last year, according to Reuters calculation. California is the biggest U.S. state for zero emission vehicles.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter and embrace of Republicans has sparked concerns about Tesla's brand, especially in liberal states like California.
Tesla has been slashing prices in the United States since January, cutting prices six times in the key market.

The price cuts, which were also carried out in China, Europe and other countries, hit Tesla's first-quarter margins, pushing its shares down nearly 10% on Thursday.
Musk this week signaled the EV maker would prioritize sales growth ahead of profit in a weak economy.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The U.S. military evacuated American government personnel from Khartoum, President Joe Biden said on Saturday, adding that Washington is suspending operations at its embassy there as fighting between Sudan's rival commanders continued.
"This tragic violence in Sudan has already cost the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians," Biden said in a statement. "It's unconscionable and it must stop."
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that "all U.S. personnel and their dependents" have been safely evacuated and that the U.S. will continue to assist Americans in Sudan in planning for their own safety.
All U.S. government personnel and a small number of diplomatic personnel from other countries were evacuated in the operation, which removed fewer than 100 people, U.S. officials said.
Just over 100 U.S. special operations forces were involved in the evacuation, entering and exiting Sudan without being fired upon by the warring factions on the ground, U.S. military officials said.
Other foreign nationals began evacuating from a Red Sea port in Sudan on Saturday. Japan's TBS news reported that the United Nations staff members including Japanese nationals and their families would be evacuated from Sudan as early as Sunday.
The bloody onslaught of urban warfare has trapped large numbers in the Sudanese capital, disabling the airport and rendering some roads impassable.
The U.N. and foreign states have urged rival military leaders to honour declared ceasefires that have mostly been ignored, and to open safe passage for fleeing civilians and the supply of badly needed aid.
Sudan's sudden collapse into warfare dashed plans to restore civilian rule, brought an already impoverished country to the brink of humanitarian disaster and threatened a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers, four years after the overthrow of long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a popular uprising.
With the airport closed and skies unsafe, thousands of foreigners - including embassy staff, aid workers and students in Khartoum and elsewhere in Africa's third largest country - have also been unable to get out.
Saudi Arabia has evacuated Gulf citizens from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, 650 km (400 miles) from Khartoum. Jordan will use the same route for its nationals.
'HOURS OF TERROR'
Western countries are expected to send planes for their citizens from Djibouti, though the Sudanese army has said airports in Khartoum and Darfur's biggest city, Nyala, are problematic and it was not clear when that might be possible.
The army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the rival RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have failed to observe ceasefires agreed almost daily since hostilities broke out on April 15.
Saturday's fighting breached what was meant to be a three-day truce from Friday to allow citizens to reach safety and visit family during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Each side accused the other of not respecting the truce.
"I don't have a problem with the ceasefire," Hemedti told Al Arabiya TV late on Saturday. The army "did not respect it. If they respect it, so will we."
Any let-up in fighting could accelerate a desperate rush to flee by many Khartoum residents, after days trapped in homes or districts under bombardment and with fighters roaming the streets.
Residents of Khartoum and the adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri reported air strikes near the state broadcaster and battles in several areas including near the army headquarters.
One Bahri resident said there had been no water or electricity for a week and frequent air strikes. "We are waiting for the big fight. We are terrified of what's coming," she said, messaging later: "It's started."
TV feeds showed a huge cloud of black smoke rising from Khartoum airport.
Medecins Sans Frontieres appealed for safe passage. "We need ports of entry where we can bring specialist trauma staff and medical supplies," said Abdalla Hussein, Sudan operations manager for the medical charity.
The Sudanese doctors union said more than two-thirds of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service, with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in crossfire.
HUMANITARIAN RISK
Beyond Khartoum, reports of the worst violence have come from Darfur, a western region that suffered a conflict which escalated from 2003 leaving 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced.
A U.N. update on Saturday said looters had taken at least 10 World Food Programme vehicles and six other food trucks after overrunning the agency's offices and warehouses in Nyala, south Darfur.
There has been no sign that either side can secure a quick victory or is ready to talk. The army has air power but the RSF is widely embedded in urban areas.
Burhan said on Saturday that "we all need to sit as Sudanese and find the right way out to return hope and life," his most conciliatory comments since fighting began.
Earlier in the clashes, he declared the RSF a rebel force, ordered it to be disbanded, and said a military solution was the only option. Hemedti said on Saturday he could not negotiate with Burhan.

Since Bashir's overthrow and after a 2021 coup, Burhan and Hemedti held the top positions on a ruling council that was meant to hand over to civilian rule and merge the RSF into the army.
The World Health Organization reported on Friday that 413 people had been killed and 3,551 injured since fighting broke out. The death toll includes at least five aid workers in a country reliant on food aid.

Investing.com -- U.S. data will shed more light on the future path of interest rates while megacap earnings will test this year’s rally in tech stocks. European bank earnings will show the impact from last month’s banking crisis, Eurozone data will inform the ECB’s decision making and the new BOJ governor chairs his first policy meeting.
Investors are trying to gauge whether the Federal Reserve will keep hiking rates to fight inflation after a widely anticipated 25 basis point hike at its May policy meeting. Many expect the central bank to cut rates later this year to loosen the grip of higher borrowing costs on the economy.
Thursday’s figures on first quarter GDP along with the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the core PCE price index and the employment cost index, both due out on Friday, will be closely watched.
GDP data is expected to point to solid growth, with consumer spending remaining strong. While the headline PCE price index is expected to fall the core reading is forecast to remain elevated. The employment cost index is also expected to tick higher, consistent with still sticky inflation.
The economic calendar also features reports on consumer confidence, durable goods orders, pending and new home sales, initial jobless claims, inflation expectations and regional manufacturing activity.
Earnings results from some of the biggest names in tech are due out in the coming week in what will be a key test for markets with investors on the lookout to see if strong gains in the tech sector so far this year are justified.
Three out of the four largest U.S. companies by market value - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) - are all scheduled to report, with Microsoft and Alphabet due out Tuesday followed by Amazon on Thursday. Facebook (NASDAQ:META) parent Meta Platforms is sandwiched in between on Wednesday.
Amazon shares rose 3% on Friday after a research firm predicted the online retailer's business in North America would beat Wall Street's estimates.
Investors have gravitated towards tech and growth stocks this year thinking the Fed will soon stop hiking interest rates and that the sector will remain resilient as growth slows. This has helped shore up equity markets despite worries over the prospect of a recession and last month's banking crisis triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank (OTC:SBNY).
Some big-name European banks are due to report earnings in the coming week, including UBS (SIX:UBSG), Deutsche Bank (ETR:DBKGn), Santander (BME:SAN) and Barclays (LON:BARC).
The results are coming after what was a very turbulent first quarter for banks following the collapse of two regional U.S. lenders last month and the dramatic demise of Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) and its hastily arranged takeover by rival UBS.
The episode wiped almost $180 billion off the value of Europe's banks at one point. The sector has since recovered, but it's still worth $70 billion less than it was before Silicon Valley collapsed in early March.
Credit Suisse has brought forward the release of its results to Monday, a day before UBS releases its first-quarter earnings.
The Eurozone is to release advance data on first quarter GDP on Friday, while April inflation reports from the region’s largest economies Germany, France and Spain are due out the same day.
Recent economic data has indicated that while the bloc’s economy remains resilient inflation is still persistent despite tighter monetary policy.
The strong performance in the Eurozone’s dominant services sector could mean that wage pressures remain elevated, hampering the European Central Bank's efforts to return inflation back to its 2% target.
The ECB is expected to raise interest rates for a seventh straight meeting at its upcoming May meeting, with most analysts expecting a 25-basis point hike, although a larger increase has not been ruled out.
New Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda chairs his first policy meeting on Friday and while analysts are not expecting any changes to the central bank's ultra-dovish monetary policy they are on the alert for any potential surprises.
Ueda is under intense scrutiny over how he might steer the BOJ away from the massive stimulus program in place over the last decade without posing risks to market stability.
Japanese inflation is outstripping estimates but comments by Ueda in recent weeks indicate he believes stimulus settings remain appropriate for now.

Investing.com - Looks like oil bears are defying OPEC+ again. And looks like OPEC+ will do the predictable thing again.
Crude prices had their first weekly decline in five as persistent U.S. rate hike and recession fears ended a rally in place since the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their 10 independent allies steered by Russia devised an output maneuver to rescue the market from 15-month lows.
The price move in the just-ended week wasn’t too large, with the drop being less than 6% — versus the four previous weeks when WTI rallied a total of 24% and Brent 18%.
What stood out about this decline was WTI’s return to below $80 a barrel by Friday’s close. Technical analysts say the U.S. crude benchmark still has a gap that needs to be filled between its March 31 settlement of $75.67 and the April 3 open of $80.10. That means WTI could drop to mid-$70 in the coming week, which could be another bearish week for oil before the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate decision on May 3.
If WTI gets to $75 or below, Brent, which trades at a $5 premium to the U.S. benchmark, risks dipping beneath the $80 mark too. This could again raise the ire of OPEC+. But is it all of OPEC+ that we need to be concerned about? Or is it just one name within the alliance?
Let's examine, beginning with Russia. The truth is Russia really doesn’t need to sell oil at $80 a barrel or more. Sure, the G7’s $60 per barrel cap on Urals crude is annoying to Vladimir Putin — both from a sovereign point and the negative impact it has in funding the Russian president's occupation of Ukraine.
Even so, with the G7, the powers within the Kremlin are realistic about what they’re up against: an entire global network of oil shippers, tanker insurers, issuers of letters of credit (i.e. banks) and other service providers who have no choice but to follow the dictates of the U.S. Treasury, or be sanctioned themselves.
As such, Moscow is content to supply as many barrels as necessary to willing customers (read: Indians and Chinese) at prices that work for both buyer/seller. And until a month ago at least, those prices were at or below the G7 cap.
The price Russia has paid on the West’s sanctions is, however, debatable.
According to Russian government data, revenue from oil and gas rose by 28%, or 2,500 billion rubles, in 2022. Converted, that comes to a neat $36.7 billion. Arguably, that spike was the result of the net increase in crude prices before the G7 price cap came into force in December last year. Global benchmark Brent went from just over $77 a barrel in December 2021 to a 14-year high above $139 in March 2022, right after the Ukraine invasion. After a selloff in the third quarter triggered by softer demand and growth worry, Brent finished last year at under $86.
Notwithstanding the G7 price cap, the West’s actions against Russia turned out to be manna from heaven for Indian oil importers and refiners, who imported record numbers of barrels from Russia at fire-sale prices, rebranded them as Indian oil and resold them at a premium.
The buyers included some of the same G7 nations, which knew only too well what was going on. It was what Washington desired anyway: The world should not be deprived of Russian oil, which is critical to a market already squeezed by OPEC cuts and other production outages. Also, the Biden administration’s aim was to throttle funding for Putin’s war in Ukraine and the price cap appears to have started doing that, the White House said.
So, price elasticity in oil is something that not just Russia but most countries within the OPEC+ alliance have learned to accept, even if they grumble about budget shortfalls from oil revenue.
Four of the Arab region’s most prolific oil producers, from second largest Iraq to the other three in respective order — the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iran — have all learned to adjust and tighten their belts when needed; except for one: Saudi Arabia.
At a time the world economy is contracting, Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman — often cryptically referred to by his initials MbS — is plunging $7 trillion into a redevelopment plan to diversify Saudi Arabia away from its oil economy. Called Vision 2030 and centered around a futuristic work-play-and-live hub called Neom, the seemingly noble plan mooted five years ago is today high in grandiosity and low on delivery. And MbS expects the rest of the world to pay for that through the Saudi hegemony of OPEC+.
The main reason OPEC+ went down the path of a second production cut announcement in four months — the first to reduce 2.0 million barrels per day was made only in November before another to take off another 1.7 million daily came in April— was to fulfill the Saudi need for $80 or more oil, which some say is critical to finance Neom, regardless what happens to the world economy.
To hear the Wall Street Journal put it, MbS “is in the midst of a plan to use his country’s gusher of oil revenue to transform its economy, rework its landscape and upend its conservative culture.” The report adds: “As prices hit $100 a barrel last year, the kingdom accelerated plans for its so-called giga-projects, which include a new city in the desert, as well as Red Sea resorts and a built-from-scratch tourism industry.”
Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman — MbS’ half brother — had promised last year to act quickly if he saw the oil market turning in the wrong direction. The back-to-back announcement of production cuts totaling 3.7 million barrels per day was apparently to fix that “wrong”, when one can argue the market was acting rightly given the concerns of demand in a recession.
“OPEC+ pre-emptive action may have been taken on accurate assumptions [that] the economy and demand … will not propel the price back above $100,” Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said on Friday.
According to OPEC+, seven of the 23 nations in the alliance — about a third of the group — will contribute to the new cuts, negotiated primarily between the Saudis and Russians to get ahead of a global slowdown. Russia, on its part, said it will extend till the end of the year the 500,000 barrels per day of cuts it pledged in March. The Saudis pledged an additional 500,000 barrels daily on top of what they claimed they were already cutting, with UAE promising 144,000, Kuwait 128,000, Oman 40,000 and Algeria 48,000. Kazakhstan — already in the news at that time over an exports blockade — pledged 78,000 barrels.
The Wall Street Journal also said Saudi Arabia wants higher crude prices to help “replenish Russia’s reserves”. That, of course, is utter fertilizer. Russian oil reserves don’t need Saudi bolstering. As the world’s biggest oil exporter, the Saudis have benefited even more from the Ukraine war than India. They, of course, did their bit for Russia too with their declaration that OPEC was apolitical and, therefore, could not condemn or would not act against Moscow over the invasion — an interesting position given that oil itself is the most politicized commodity.
The real problem with OPEC+’s production cuts — I call them maneuvers — is that like the Neom project, they are high on promise and low on stats. The original OPEC group, through most of its six decades, had a history of over-pledging and under-delivering on cuts. While the alliance achieved over-compliance on promised cuts in the aftermath of the 2020 coronavirus breakout, experts say that was more a result of battered demand that led to minimal production, rather than a will to cut barrels as pledged.
What OPEC+ is doing is using the power of the megaphone: Announce a cut, get a huge positive impact on prices, then produce what it really wants.
And if one thinks it through, it’s really quite simple to understand the OPEC+ mindset: No producer will turn away a buyer who wants more oil because the buyer will simply go to another source. With demand back at 2019 levels, almost every producer has been maxing output while publicly proclaiming adherence to production cuts.
By June though, global summer for oil is expected to accelerate, with or without production cuts. OPEC+ will simply raise output then, probably without any drama, while giving the appearance that it was still cutting the millions of barrels per day that it had pledged.
Should crude prices still totter at $70 levels or below at that time over recession worries, we know what the Saudis will do as the June 3 OPEC+ meeting approaches. The reality is MbS might not even wait till then — ordering his half-brother to take any arbitrary decision that can be dressed up later as a consensus — to push the market higher.
Oil: Market Settlements and Activity
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate for June delivery settled at $77.87 — up 50 cents, or 0.6%, on the day — as per CME data. For the week, June WTI was down 5.6% from the April 14 settlement of $82.52 for the front month contract.
On Investing.com, WTI for June delivery showed a final post-settlement trade of $77.95, as per capital.com data.
June Brent officially settled Friday’s trade at $81.66 — up 56 cents, or 0.7% — as per CME data. For the week, the global crude benchmark fell 5.4%.
London-traded Brent for June delivery showed a final trade of $81.75 per barrel on Investing.com in data published by capital.com.
Oil: Price Outlook
If oil bears attempt to force WTI to fill its April 3 gap of $75.67, Friday’s settlement of $77.87 for the June contract will first be dragged down to $77 and then be set up for a retest of the $75.80 support, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.
“After four weeks of strong positive action, WTI has fallen almost 6% for the first time in a week,” Dixit noted. “The weekly stochastics at 69/84 makes a negative overlap while RSI at 48 is positioned below neutrality of 50.”
“Major downside potential is seen at $73.80,” he added.
On the flip side, he said June WTI could move back towards $79.50, above which the 200-Day Simple Moving Average of $82.40 remains a strong resistance.”
Gold: Market Settlements and Activity
The most-active June gold futures contract on New York’s Comex settled Friday’s trade down $28.60, or 1.4%, at $1,990.50. The session bottom for June gold was $1,982.35. Since its run to a more than three year high of $2,048.60 on April 13, Comex’s most-active gold contract has lost almost 3%. For the current week, it was down 0.6%, after last week’s slide of 0.5%.
On Investing.com, gold for June delivery showed a final post-settlement trade of $1,994.10, as per capital.com data.
The spot price of gold, which reflects physical trades in bullion and is more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled down $21.17, or 1.1%, at $1,983.64. For the week, it was also down 1%.
The latest weekly decline in gold began after the Dollar Index and U.S. Treasury yields rebounded from the one-year lows hit last week. Gold is a direct contrarian trade to the dollar. Besides that, a higher dollar tends to weigh on overseas demand for commodities priced in the currency. Higher Treasury yields also sap the appeal of risk-heavy assets, while also limiting flows of foreign capital into the United States.
A relatively softer dollar in the past 24 hours, however, did not help gold.
Still, weighing on gold were concerns that the Federal Reserve will agree on another quarter point increase at its May 3rd rate decision which will bring U.S. interest rates to a peak of 5.25% — versus the pandemic-era rate of just 0.25%.
“Gold remains choppy as we near the end of the week,” said OANDA's analyst Erlam. “Uncertainty over the path of interest rates, which should become much clearer over the next month or two, is driving the indecision we're seeing in gold at the moment.”
While Erlam noted that higher Treasury yields had stalled the rally in the yellow metal, “traders are clearly in no mood to give up on the yellow metal.”
“As things stand, dips are being bought and it will be interesting to see if we see the same on this occasion as well,” he added. “Big support remains around $1,940-$1,960.”
Gold: Price Outlook
Dixit of SKCharting said an upward rebound in gold will require a strong breakout above the 5-Day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, of $1,996 and a horizontal resistance zone of $2,015 to retest the swing high of $2,048.
“Going forward into the week ahead, if the Dollar Index breaks and sustains above $109.95, we are likely to witness the dollar gaining further upside towards the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $103.10, followed by the 50-week EMA of $103.65,” said Dixit. “This may push gold lower towards the Fibonacci level of $1,955. In the event of any extended weakness, gold could even get to the 50-day EMA of $1,943.”
Natural Gas: Market Settlements and Activity
Natural gas bulls aren’t making much progress beyond the mid $2 level, but a second weekly win of 5% might assure those long on America’s favorite fuel for indoor temperature control that a price breakout could be imminent.
The most-active May gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled down 1.6 cents, or 0.7%, at $2.221 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units. For the week though, May gas was up 5.1%, mirroring last week’s run-up.
On Investing.com, gas for delivery in May shows a final post-settlement trade of $2.22, as per capital.com data.
The debate on when the bearish tide would irrevocably turn for ‘natty’ — as the all-season fuel for indoor heating and cooling is known — has raged since gas prices began their headlong fall from 14-year highs of $10 in August to crash to 2-1/2 year lows beneath $2.
At brief intervals over the past two months, the market had appeared to be on the cusp of a serious rebound — like in late February when it got above $3 after breaking below $2 earlier that month for the first time since September 2020.
This week, again, such a phenomenon appeared when the front-month May gas contract rallied to almost $2.40 — a level it had not reached since late March — exciting traders and analysts over the prospect of $3 pricing and beyond.
Friday’s slide in gas prices came as investor focus returned to the abysmal state of U.S. gas inventories held in storage, after one of the warmest winters on record.
Gas storage for the week ended April 14 rose by 75 billion cubic feet, or bcf, after all the burning done for power generation as well as for heating as some unexpected chill for this time of the year surfaced, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reported.
That 75-bcf injection bumped up total gas inventories to 1.930 trillion cubic feet, or tcf, EIA records showed. At current levels, the gas storage stands at 34% above the year-ago level of 1.442 tcf and nearly 21% higher than the five-year average of 1.601 tcf.
In the short term, Henry Hub prices could continue to recover in the higher $2 trajectory, said analysts at Houston-based energy markets advisory Gelber & Associates.
“Weather forecasts from major weather models still show a cold front coming through in the coming days, leading to colder than average end of April and beginning of May,” Gelber’s analysts said in a note issued on Friday to the firm’s natural gas clients. “This cold front is expected to increase weather-driven demand to high levels.”
But the mid-term outlook remained cloudy, the note said.
“Overall, the market still has way too much supply for these small weather runs to significantly affect the supply/demand balance,” Gelber’s analysts added.
Natural gas: Price Outlook
In what seems to be a flattening bottom which is still too early to be confirmed, natural gas futures closed above the 5-week EMA for a second time, noted Dixit of SKCharting.
“If breakout from the descending channel withstands bearish pressure, clearing through the 50-day EMA dynamically positioned at $2.52 will be an immediate challenge,” he said. “This may extend the upward move towards swing high to $3.03.”
A break below the daily Middle Bollinger Band of $2.15 may begin some decline towards the small gap left at $2.11 and extend that towards $2.04, Dixit added.

By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government may soon require natural gas-fired power plants to install technology to capture carbon emissions, sources said, as President Joe Biden's administration enacts new rules to help decarbonize the power sector in 12 years.
The Environmental Protection Agency as soon as this week is expected to unveil standards for new and existing power plants, which belch roughly a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, two sources said. The rules will replace former President Donald Trump's American Clean Energy rule and former President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, both of which were invalidated by courts.
More than a year in the making, the standards should be based on a plant's potential to reduce emissions through carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, according to clean air law experts and industry representatives in talks with the EPA.
Utility companies may need to decide whether they want to build new baseload gas plants with CCS technology or zero-emission renewable energy. States would develop plans for bringing their plants into compliance.
"These standards could level the playing field between new gas plants and new renewable energy," said Thomas Schuster, head of the Sierra Club's Pennsylvania chapter. Most new gas plants currently do not pay for emitting carbon, so the rules could make it harder for them to compete with solar and wind power.
Biden has pledged that the power business will decarbonize by 2035. According to the Clean Air Act, the standards must be based on “best system of emission reduction,” technologies deemed affordable and technically feasible.
The proposal will reflect two major developments to ensure the rules are legally defensible. One, a Supreme Court decision last July, barred EPA from forcing a system-wide shift in electric generation but allowed it to issue plant-specific rules.
Second, the Inflation Reduction Act created tax credits making carbon capture and hydrogen more affordable and affirmed EPA's authority to regulate power plants. The law offers more than $100 billion in clean electricity tax incentives, including a 70% increase in credits for each ton of carbon captured and sequestered.
"If you're building a new fossil (plant), it needs to control its emissions, said Lissa Lynch, director of the federal legal group at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Existing technology can capture and store approximately 90% of carbon emissions, Lynch said.
EPA could set varying standards for plants, applying stringent measures for ones that run constantly and easier ones for "peaker" plants which run during high power demand, Lynch said.
CLEANER POWER
U.S. Energy Information Administration figures show fossil fuels accounted for more than 60% of U.S. electricity generation in 2022, with 60% of that coming from gas and 40% from coal. Renewables accounted for 21.5%, with nuclear energy making up the rest.
The EIA projected that this year, 54% of new generation (21GW) will be solar and 14% will be natural gas (7.5GW).
Federal utility TVA has the most planned gas capacity at 5GW followed by investor-owned Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) with 3 GW planned.
TVA's portfolio in the coming decades will include carbon-free sources "and sources like natural gas that complement that diversity without sacrificing rates or reliability", a spokesperson said.
Duke plans for natural gas to be part of its mix but "operated less as baseload generation and as more of a peaking/ramping resource over time to balance out the variability in renewable resources", a spokesperson said.
Some industry representatives signaled in comments to the EPA last year that they do not think power plant standards should be based on carbon capture and storage, with the National Mining Association saying it is not an "adequately tested technology." The group cited failure of a Texas project called Petra Nova that was mothballed in 2020.

Utility Southern Company (NYSE:SO) , which is phasing out its large fleet of coal generation, said new gas turbines should be favored "to safeguard electric needs of the U.S.".
Southern, which also runs the National Carbon Capture Center with the Department of Energy, said commercial deployment of carbon capture technology "is many years away" despite the cost-reduction potential of the Inflation Reduction Act.

-Bed Bath & Beyond Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday after the home goods retailer failed to secure funds to stay afloat.
The Union, New Jersey-based home goods retailer filed for bankruptcy in a District of New Jersey court, listing both its estimated assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion and $10 billion, according to a court filing.
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) said that it has received a commitment of approximately $240 million in debtor-in-possession financing from Sixth Street Specialty Lending Inc, according to a separate statement.
The company added that its 360 Bed Bath & Beyond and 120 buybuy BABY stores and websites will remain open and continue serving customers as it begins efforts to effect the closure of its retail locations.
In February, the embattled retailer had planned to raise around $1 billion through the offering of preferred stock and warrants to avoid bankruptcy.

The company was able to raise $360 million from the complex deal helping it pay loan defaults and interest payments for senior notes.
But Bed Bath terminated the deal in late March and announced plans to sell $300 million worth of its shares while also once again warning it might have to file for bankruptcy if it could not secure the funds.

(Reuters) - British chipmaker Arm Ltd is building its own semiconductor to showcase the capabilities of its products, as it seeks to attract new customers and fuel growth following its Initial Public Offering (IPO) later this year, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
Arm will team up with manufacturing partners to develop the new semiconductor, FT said, citing people briefed on the move, adding that the company has built a new "solutions engineering" team that will lead the development of these prototype chips for mobile devices, laptops and other electronics.
The SoftBank Group Corp-backed company's newest chip, on which it started work in the past six months, is "more advanced" than ever before, FT said, citing industry executives.
The chip designer has no plans to sell or license the product and is only working on a prototype, FT said.
Arm is a major supplier of intellectual property to many chip companies, especially in mobile phones and has partnerships with major chip contract manufacturers.

Earlier this month, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) said it will work with Arm to ensure that mobile phone chips and other products that use Arm's technology can be made in Intel's factories.
Arm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

2023-04-23 19:14:34,067 - INFO - PARIS (Reuters) - France and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania expressed dismay after China's ambassador in Paris questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet countries like Ukraine.
Asked about his position on whether Crimea is part of Ukraine or not, Chinese ambassador Lu Shaye said in an interview aired on French television on Friday that historically it was part of Russia and had been offered to Ukraine by former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
"These ex-USSR countries don't have actual status in international law because there is no international agreement to materialize their sovereign status," Shaye added.
France responded on Sunday by stating its "full solidarity" with all the allied countries affected, which it said had acquired their independence "after decades of oppression".
"On Ukraine specifically, it was internationally recognized within borders including Crimea in 1991 by the entire international community, including China," a foreign ministry spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added that China will have to clarify whether these comments reflect its position or not.

The three Baltic states, all formerly part of the Soviet Union, reacted along the same lines as France.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

(Reuters) -Climate change campaigners gathered in New York's Times Square on Earth Day to urge action on global warming and cuts in plastics use while volunteers worldwide planted trees and cleared trash to mark the 54th annual celebration of the environment.
Earth Day this year, officially on Saturday, follows weeks of extreme weather with temperatures soaring to record highs in Thailand and a punishing heatwave in India, where at least 13 people died of heatstroke at a ceremony last weekend.
Average global temperatures could hit all-time highs in 2023 or 2024, climate scientists have warned.
Pope Francis, who has championed green causes since his election in 2013, urged people to look after the environment.
"The Book of Genesis tells us that the Lord entrusted human beings with the responsibility of being stewards of creation (Gen 2:15). Care for the Earth, then, is a moral obligation for all men and women as children of God #EarthDay," he tweeted on Saturday.
"Climate impacts are here," Areeba Hamid, co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said on Friday as climate change activists walked down the street outside parliament in London, some dressed in green costumes and green paint.
Hamid said when she now visits her hometown of Delhi, it feels like "putting your head in the oven" and that London's 2022 heatwave was like "a dystopian film".
"We can't afford that anymore."
Activists led by the Extinction Rebellion group have gathered in London to kick off a four-day action, billed "The Big One", to coincide with Earth Day.
About 30,000 people have signed up for family-friendly rallies and marches, marking a change in strategy for a group known for its disruptive tactics, including blocking roads, throwing paint and smashing windows.
CLEAN-UPS AND RITUALS
Globally, there was a flurry of activity in the run-up to Earth Day, with events being planned in Rome and Boston and major clean-up campaigns at Lake Dal in India's Srinagar and Florida's hurricane-hit Cape Coral.
In Peru, shamans on Friday made an offering to the "Pachamama", or Mother Earth. Holding yellow flowers and rattles, the shamans walked around a papier-mache globe as they performed a cleansing ritual.
The ancestral rituals - whose origins lie in the Indigenous cultures of Peru - are done to thank the Earth and build awareness of the planet, said Walter Alarcon, the president of the Healing Shamans of Peru International Organization.
New York City banned cars on streets in at least 31 locations for five hours on Saturday and held concerts in Times Square. In Washington, the Climate Justice Alliance marched, calling for an end of the fossil fuel era, accompanied by a brass jazz band.
Earlier in the week, U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to increase funding to help developing countries fight climate change and curb deforestation in Brazil's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest during a meeting with top world leaders. Domestically, he ordered a number of new measures that would protect communities overburdened by pollution, including creating a new White House office of environmental justice and launching a national strategy to prevent plastic pollution.
Governments have fallen far short of pledges in the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit heating of the climate by shifting off fossil fuels, amid crises including COVID-19, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, food shortages and strained ties between China and the U.S., the top two greenhouse gas emitters.

A report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says the planet is on track to warm beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times - a key threshold for even more damaging impacts - between 2030 and 2035.
"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all," the IPCC has said. "The choices and actions implemented in this decade will have impacts now and for thousands of years."
